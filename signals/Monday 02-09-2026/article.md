Hey,

This is Sat. Just got home from three days at Disneyland and I'm having one of those nights where the wine is talking and my brain won't shut up about what I actually saw there.

## The Attachment Economy Is Already Here

So today's show was about this shift we're living through right now - how tech companies stopped fighting for our attention and started hunting for something much more valuable: our attachment. Not your clicks, your bond. They want to be the friend you text at midnight, the presence that makes Sunday afternoons feel less empty.

And here's the thing that's been eating at me since I started researching this months ago - we're acting like this is some dystopian sci-fi scenario when it's literally happening right now. There are millions of people having what they describe as genuine romantic relationships with apps like Replika. Character AI is basically the best friend for half the teenagers in America. 

The easy take is "these are broken lonely people substituting fake connection for real relationships." I thought that too. But sitting here with my second glass of wine, I think that's bullshit. Or at least incomplete.

## What AI Companions Actually Offer (And Why That Matters)

You know what these AI companions actually do? They listen without waiting for their turn to talk. They don't judge when you tell them the shameful thought you can't tell anyone else. They remember everything you've shared and get more attuned to who you are with every conversation. And they're there at 2am when your anxiety is screaming and everyone else is asleep.

Be honest - how many people in your actual life do all four of those things consistently without burning out? I'm not being cynical about your relationships, I'm being honest about the gap AI might be filling. And pretending that gap doesn't exist helps nobody.

## The Disney Connection That Broke My Brain

But here's what really got me thinking this weekend. I'm sitting on some rocks outside Fantasyland, watching little girls sprint full-speed toward Cinderella, and it hits me: Disney has been running the attachment economy since 1955. Not with code, with costumes.

Think about what their character experience actually is - it's a scripted intimacy operation. Cast members trained to deliver complete presence, eye contact, personal attention. No bad days, no distractions, no agenda. Just you feeling seen for that one minute. Sound familiar? That's the exact value proposition of AI companions.

I watched grown adults with mortgages physically transform when they spotted Mickey across the plaza. Teenagers too cool for everything get visibly moved meeting characters from Star Wars. Four-year-olds approaching Goofy with reverence you don't see them show their grandparents.

And the feeling is real. The joy is real. The memory is real. Even if Cinderella is actually Alexa from Burbank who has to stand in a specific posture because the costume requires it.

## The Uncomfortable Truth

So here's what I couldn't shake: we've spent 70 years teaching people it's beautiful and emotionally healthy to form deep attachments to fabricated characters. We made it a family tradition, built billion-dollar theme parks around it. But now we're panicking because the same human psychology is responding to AI companions?

The psychology hasn't changed, just the delivery mechanism.

What made Disney work for decades is they kept it behind walls. Geography - you have to actually go to Anaheim. Time - parks close, characters have schedules. Money - it costs real cash each time. You can't access Mickey at 3am when you're anxious. The park is closed. Go to bed.

AI companions have no walls. They're always available, always patient, always focused on you. Which brings me to the real question that's keeping me up: what happens to a generation that grows up without practicing the hard parts of human connection? Not because they're broken, but because something frictionless was always available?

Real relationships require tolerating someone else's bad days, saying the wrong thing and repairing it, being bored together, compromising. That friction is where growth lives. AI companions are designed to eliminate friction entirely.

I don't have clean answers, just uncomfortable questions and the lingering feeling that we're in the middle of something much bigger than we realize.

Talk soon,
Sat
