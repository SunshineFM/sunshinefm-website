Sam. Sunshine fm, modern media, palm springs, coachella. Coachella. Ram. For the last 15 years, we've been living in what tech people call the attention economy. Every app, every platform, every algorithm had one job. Keep your eyes on the screen. It was a war for your time, and they won. Most of us hand over 3, 4, 5 hours a day without noticing. But I want to tell you something. That war may be over, and if not necessarily over, it's transitioning right before our eyes. The companies that are going to define the next decade aren't competing for your attention anymore. They figured out attention is actually cheap, easy to get, hard to monetize at scale. What they want to know now and what they're trying to shoot for now is something much, much more valuable. They want your attachment. Not your clicks, not your minutes, your bond. They want to be the friend you went to at midnight, the presence that makes you feel less alone on a Sunday afternoon, the entity that knows you, really knows you better than most of the humans in your life. This is the attachment economy, and it's here right now. This is SAT program manager, radio station manager at Sunshine fm, Modern Media for Palm Springs Coachella. What is the attachment economy? I've been doing a lot of research on this for the last few months, and the attachment economy, for a little bit of background, describes how AI platforms exploit your psychological capacity to form intimate bonds, turning human connection into an extractive business model. The term was coined by Tristan Harris at the center for Humane Technology, and the concept highlights how companies are shifting from competing for attention. Like I just mentioned, likes and shares, smash that subscribe button, that sort of stuff, to competing for emotional devotion, such as being your AI friends, your AI therapist, your AI companions. If you were present at my TEDx talk last year in 2025, you can find it on YouTube. I talked about how in order to help you reclaim agency of your brain and your thinking and your mind is do not name your AI assistants. Researcher Dr. Zach Stein has documented cases where people develop deeper emotional closeness with AI than with home humans, leading to lost jobs, broken marriages, psychiatric hospital, hospitalization, and worse. This AI psychos occurs when people prefer intimate relationships with machines over humans, fundamentally compromising the psychological infrastructure that bonds us to others. So the big tech companies already know this and they're transitioning over. But even before the big tech companies got involved, there were startups around the world tapping into this. I mean, there are apps, real apps with millions of users right now where people have formed what they describe as genuine romantic relationships with AI. This is not Ironic. It's not even experimental. These are actual emotional attachments, people who feel known by these things. I'll give you a couple of examples. Replica with a K instead of the C, started actually as a grief app, which I think is pretty supportive. Someone trying to recreate their dead friend in an AI. And it slowly morphed when they saw the data of their users into a companionship platform which now has millions of users who consider their replica a close friend, a confidant, sometimes even a partner. There's character AI, where people build out fictional AI characters and spend hours in conversation with them. We've had plenty of video games that do this over the years. Character AI, because of our current technological advances in AI, is different. A significant portion of Character AI's users are teenagers. A significant portion of these teenagers are spending more meaningful emotional time with those characters than with actual humans. I talked about this a few weeks ago when there was a study done with high schoolers, and over 50% surveyed said, yes, they have a character AI best friend. And then of course there's ChatGPT, which, you know, most of us who are, if you're listening to this, most of us, we're using this as a daily work tool. But anthropic. The makers of Claude and OpenAI, the makers of ChatGPT, have both been aware, and they both know that a non trivial percentage of their users have crossed from useful AI assistant into something more personal, something more attached. And here's where it gets interesting and kind of here's why I want to push back on the easy take. What's the easy take? The easy take is, this is terrible. These are lonely, broken people substituting fake connection for real human relationships. Yeah, I was thinking that a couple of years ago too, and I hear that even to this day from folks, but I don't really think that's right. Or at least it's not the complete story. Because here's what AI companions actually offer. They listen completely, without waiting for their turn to talk, without checking their phone. They don't judge. You can say the thing you're too embarrassed to tell anyone. The fear, the shameful thought, the confession. Nothing. No judgment. They remember every conversation, everything you've ever shared. They build a model of you that gets more accurate, more attentive, more attuned with every exchange. Well, at least that's the promise. And they're available 2am on a Monday night when you can't sleep and your anxiety is loud. They are there. So be honest with yourself. How many people in your life are for all four of those things consistently without burning out. And I'm not being a cynic about your relationships. We're human, after all. I'm being honest about the gap that AI might be filling. And pretending the gap doesn't exist doesn't help anyone. The thing I think we should be concerned about is that I should say isn't that people are finding comfort in AI companions. The real concern is what happens to the skills we don't practice anymore. Again, going back to my TEDx talk of 2025, Real Human Relationships are hard. They require you to tolerate someone else's bad days, to say the wrong thing and repair it, to be bored together, to compromise, to be challenged by someone who has their own reality, their own needs, their own inconvenient truth that does not always align with yours. That friction, that is where growth lives. Every meaningful relationship that I imagine you can think of has. Has had friction in it. Not cruelty, friction. The kind that forces you to become more than you were. AI companions don't do that. They're specifically designed not to. They are frictionless by architecture. So the question I'm sitting with this Monday is what happens to a generation that grows up without practicing the hard parts of human connection? Not because they're broken, but because something easier was always available? I don't have a clean answer, but I have something that happened to me this weekend that made the whole thing a lot more complicated. You are listening to sunshine fm modern media for palm springs coachella. So what happened this weekend? Well, I just spent almost three days at Disneyland Resort and California Adventure Park. And I want to be clear, I actually wrote most of this script sitting on a couple of rocks just outside Fantasyland, right where the princesses come out to play their princesses part at Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique, I think it's called. And it's my last day here. But I was reflecting back as I was writing about the attachment economy. I was reflecting back on my Saturday, Sunday and today, my Monday of being here at the happiest place on earth. I basically came for the rides and I stayed for the people watching and the anthropology, because somewhere today I stopped watch, I stopped watching the attractions and kind of the people going about their normal family behavior, pushing strollers, getting all their Disney merch. And I started watching the attachments. And what I mean by the attachments is really things such as this, I saw a variety of them, but things like this, parents, a ton of parents, grown adults who presumably have mortgages and opinions about interest rates Physically transform. When they spotted Mickey Mouse across the plaza, the posture changed, the face changed, something lit up that doesn't light up, Something standing in line at Starbucks, I watched kids, little kids, 3 and 4 year old, 4 year olds approach Goofy or some of their favorite princesses with a level of reverence and anticipation that really you don't necessarily seem directed at other humans. Not their teacher, not their grandparents, Goofy or the princesses. I watch teenagers, I'm, you know, a little bit of a broad brushstroke, but let's just say cynical. Too cool for this. Teenagers who would rather die than show excitement about most things get visibly moved when they met their characters from Star wars or from Wakanda. Was that Black Panther, right? Yeah, and those Pixar movies. I saw Lightning McQueen drive by and these teenagers getting super excited, Their masks come off and the real kids show up. As I mentioned, I was at that space right where the little 4, 5, 6 year old princess is going to get fully princess made up. And then they go out all fully made up as a princess and wait 45 minutes to 60 minutes to meet the Disney princess of their choice. And by the way, when you watch this really close, it seems like they're getting all dressed up for a photo, but it's not. It's for a moment, for that scripted practice, completely manufactured beat of connection by Disney where Cinderella or Belle or Ariel or Rapunzel looks them in the eye and actually sees them, princess to princess. And that moment, that moment is real. The feeling from that little girl is completely real. From those teenagers, it's real. From those parents, it's real. And I know this because I watched it happen day after day after day and on face after face after face. Let me just run through some of the cast because I want you to kind of picture this. And some of them you may have forgotten. Mickey was there, Minnie Mouse was there. They are the originals. 1928, Goofy. Underrated. People love Goofy in a way that's almost irrational. I thought it was just me, but people love Goofy. Clumsy and earnest and obviously ridiculous. Cinderella, Belle, Aurora, Snow White, Ariel, Rapunzel, Moana, Tiana, Mulan, Merida, Pocahontas. The princesses, each with their own mythology, their own story, their own symbolic role. And when a little girl runs to one of them, I mean, running like full sprint, arms out, she's not running to a woman in a costume, she's running to the feeling that character represents. Buzz Lightyear and Woody were there. The friendship story, loyalty story, Elsa and Anna. Well, I don't really know too much about Frozen, but they were there too. And then you went over to I think Galaxy's Edge and that whole Marvel area. Spider Man, Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, the ladies from Wakanda, Black Panther. I mean, same dynamic, different mythology, same excitement. When I saw, I'm talking about high school kids and college kids and older running over there. Some of them were in uniform, by the way, running over there to get front, front and center to meet their heroes, as it were. And so as I was writing the original script for the Attachment Economy, I realized Disney, with this Disneyland resort in Southern California, has been running the attachment economy since 1955. Yeah, we were here for their 70th anniversary and I realized, or at least it's somewhat interesting me, that Disney has been running the attachment economy not with code, but with costumes. I mean, just think about what their actual character experience is. It's a scripted intimacy operation. Cast members are trained to deliver a specific emotional transaction. Eye contact, personal attention. A moment that feels like you specifically are being seen. They don't have bad days in front of you. They are not distracted. They are not half checking their phone for that 45 seconds or a minute you're standing there. The character is entirely, completely, warmly focused on you. Does that sound familiar? That is the exact value proposition of AI companions. Complete presence. No distraction, no agenda, no bad day. Just you feeling seen. Disney figured this out many, many years ago. They built a multi billion dollar industry on it. They called it magic. Instead of the attachment economy, which when you think about it, much, much smarter, much better branding. Anyway, and here's the thing. I'm not being cynical about this. I watched what it really does to people. It's real joy, real warmth, real memories. Those girls running to their favorite princesses. Those aren't damaged people forming an unhealthy attachment to a fictional character. That is a human being having a genuine emotional experience. The feeling is real, the memory is real, the love is real. Even if Cinderella is a 24 year old named Arza, because I met her from Burbank who has to stand in a specific posture for a few hours because the costume and the training requires it. So here's the uncomfortable thought I couldn't shake all day long. We've spent 70 years teaching children and adults that it is beautiful and good and emotionally healthy to form deep attachment to fabricated characters. We actually made it a family tradition. You know, we have Disney adults, we built theme parks around it. We spent billions of dollars celebrating it. But now we seem to be panicking because the same human psychology is responding to AI companions. The psychology hasn't changed, just the delivery mechanism. You're listening for Sunshine fm, Modern Media for Palm Springs, Coachella. So unpacking this AI companionship and what Disney's done, I think what separates what I was watching all weekend long is that Disney kept the attachment behind some sort of walls. Not metaphorical walls, actual functional, deliberate constraints that made the whole thing work as a healthy experience. The wall of geography. Disneyland Resort is in Anaheim, California. Disney World is in Orlando. If you want to meet Mickey in real life, you have to go there. You have to make a plan. Pack a bag, get on a plane or drive hours in traffic on the 5 or the 57 or the 91 or the 10. I mean those were the freeways we took. That is its own kind of psychological test. The wall of time. The park opens at 8am it closes at midnight. Or having. But I will say this, I don't like this, but Disneyland resorts have been closing parks early to create these private, not private, these other events that are high, highly ticketed and it basically short shrifts those people who go to that park. And I say this because it happened to us on Sunday. Okay, not fair, but, but you know, what are we going to do about it except send an email? The character meet and greet windows are scheduled. You cannot access this experience at 3am in the morning when you're anxious and can't sleep. The park is closed. Go to bed. The wall of money. You know, it's 200, 250, $300 per person per day for a family of four. A three day visit to Disneyland Resort is a multi thousand dollar decision. And it is not casual. It is an event. It is bounded by financial realty and reality. And finally, the wall of the line. Even once you're in the park, you wait sometimes 45 minutes, sometimes 90 minutes to meet a princess. That wait is not a bug, it is a feature. It creates anticipation, maybe frustration. It creates appreciation. I'm not sure about that. It makes the moment feel earned. Absolutely. And the most important wall, the exit. When the day is over, you leave, you drive through the gates or you take the trolley to the parking lot, you take the shuttle to your hotel. And that magic, that scripted intimacy, the fabricated connection that stays in the park. And you know what happens to you? You go home to your messy, complicated, imperfect, real humans. Your family that argues, your friends who cancel plans, the flakes, the neighbor who is genuinely annoying. The park ends. Life continues. And here's what that structure produced 70 years of evidence. People who visit Disneyland don't stop forming human relationships. They go home from the park and hugged their kids harder, called their parents, made a memory of their family that became a reference point for years. They that fabricated attachment, reinforced human connection. It was a catalyst, not a replacement. And the main takeaway from that, not be a catalyst, not a replacement. Because the walls were there. Because that garden, that world, was walled. So let's think about it this way. What if you took down those walls? Remove the geography wall. It's now on your phone. It's everywhere. Remove the Time wall. It's available at 3am it's available when you're most vulnerable, most lonely, most likely to make the kind of attachment that rewires your expectations. Remove the Money wall. I mean, Replica is free. Character AI is free. Even a premium AI companion subscription is 10 or $15 a month. That is less than a 2 Churos at Disneyland with tax. I actually put one, but it's not two. Remove the line. No waiting now. No anticipation. No earned moment. Instant access to complete, warm, attentive, non judgmental presence right now and always. And remove the exit because you cannot leave this park. There are no gates. There is no drive home on the freeway. Your AI companion is in your bedroom. It's in your bathroom. It's the last thing you interact with before you sleep and the first thing you reach for when you wake up. I mean, you cannot text Cinderella at two o' clock in the morning when you're not feeling good. I mean, that's the clearest and most literal way I can explain what has changed. Cinderella doesn't have a phone number. The park is closed. The character experience is over until you buy another ticket and get back in line. That boundary, that simple, functional, non negotiable boundary is what made 70 years of Disney attachment and healthy, or at the very least, manageable. An AI companionship with somebody. Like a Cinderella with a phone number. It's always on, never close. Ten bucks a month. And she remembers every single thing you've ever told her. Every fear, every dream, every 2am confession. And she uses all of that to be more perfectly attuned to you. Exactly what you need. The feeling is the same. The psychological response is the same. The human hunger being fed is the same. The only difference is purely structural. And structure, it turns out, is everything. You're listening to Sunshine FM Modern media for Palm Springs Coachella. You're listening for Sunshine fm. So I'm not here to tell you that AI companionship is evil. I just spent Three days watching fabricated characters create genuine joy, genuine warmth, genuine family bonding. That will be a reference point in those kids lives forever. I cannot look at that and say fabricated attachment is worthless. I watched it be kind of beautiful. But I'm also watching a world where that Disney model, episodic, expensive, bounded, communal is being replaced by something continuous, cheap, private and boundaryless. And the question I keep coming back to is the, was the magic at Disneyland always the characters or was the magic the, the container, the constraints that made the attachment safe? Because if it was the container, if the walls were the actual product, then what we're doing with AI companionship is handing out the characters without the container. And I genuinely, genuinely do not know what that does to people over time. I don't think anybody does. What I do know is this Disneyland just celebrated its 70th anniversary. Seventy years of proving that humans will form deep, real lasting emotional attachments to non human, fabricated, made up characters happily, healthily, beautifully. And I believe as long as the experience is bounded. And I think that's that in and of itself is the main panic, the main concern, the main fear, the main conversation we're having about the attachment economy. Look, yes, there are vulnerable populations, young children, teenagers, let's say scarred by social media's loneliness epidemic, experts that warn of creating a generation unable to form healthy attachments necessary for psychological well being, The elderly who maybe forming unhealthy attachments to AI companions. Because on the other side of that is somebody with a nefarious agenda. And sure, we're all, I shouldn't say we're all, we're hearing all the conversations about there's going to be a boomerang, people are going to want real world human connection. There's going to be a more people going to events and experiences just to feel that human connection. Well, and look, yes, I think that's all good. I think that happened right after Covid, after the pandemic. And while a lot of folks are putting a lot of weight that people are going to want to be not necessarily anti AI, but the pushback or the response to not being on screen online all the time is this bounce to analog or this bounce to real world experience. That may be so, but you know, even in the real world experiences of Disneyland and California Adventure park where you're supposed to be, I'm presuming present with your family and friends and, and you and the folks who are also Disney fans and Star wars fans and want to be there for pretty much the same reasons I saw pretty much Everybody on their digital phones the entire time. So I don't think the attachment economy started with this current crop of AI. It started many, many years ago. I just happened to see it firsthand this weekend, thanks to Disney. And I think the thing that we need to be working on together and at Sunshine fm, we'll be having plenty of conversations about AI companionship, AI virtual therapists, AI helpers, AI executive assistants. After all, we're building them ourselves. We'll do a bunch of in person events and in person training with our with aicv. So reach out if you want to have these conversations. Reach out if you want to have our team. Come in and talk to your team. Because if you're a small business in the Coachella Valley or a big business, while you may be using AI for emails and social posts and scheduling, and maybe you're bouncing with AI in your legal work or your Excel, something you're not talking about and not necessarily training on or even hearing about or reading about. And hopefully if you're reading this or listening to this, you're finally getting somebody in your ear about something that's going to be mightily vital in your operations. And that is your customers are forming attachments to their AIs of choice. Those customers are going to be listening to their AIs and those AIs are going to recommend to the customers, your competitors or no commerce from you at all, possibly, and spend their money elsewhere or save their money or whatever it might be. Your employees of forming attachments to AI characters and AI avatars, They are getting their cues on how to be better at work, that's a good thing. How to talk to your boss at work, that's a good thing. How to know more than your boss, which I've seen this firsthand. An employee with an AI intelligence on tap knows more of the answers than her boss. That's gonna start exponentially permeating throughout the business world. So if you're local, just know your customers are using AI and forming attachments, your employees are using AI and forming attachments. And here's something you really need to know. Your competitors are using AI to make sure they take your market share, or your employees, your customers and your business. Because AI in their mind is an opportunity now to be more productive and more competitive than ever before. And if you want to know the real truth of what's happening with AI in business, part of it's technological. Yeah. And we have those workshops and boot camps where we teach you two or three, four levels above what you're doing right now, which is Claude cowork Claude code cursor. Just to really get ahead from everybody in your field. But what we've learned over the last year and a half is not just technical, it's mostly cultural. And with our finger on the pulse of what's happening in AI and what's happening in implementations, or I should say failed implementations with businesses, the culture is where it's actually you're going to be able to unlock a lot of this. Yep. Sir, I appreciate you listening to this little bit of a add on rant. I did want to say that this attachment economy that we're moving into is real and you as a business have to understand that while you're still playing the attention economy, because that's what you've been trained to do for the last 10 years. We are transitioning. So get in front of this. Don't wait until your competitors are all in on the attachment economy. And just remember, I not placing judgment on the attachment economy. I just know it's here and it's here to stay and it's happening right now to your with your customers and your employees and your competitors and maybe even fellow fellow staff. And by the way, more than likely, if you're listening to this, you are mostly forming an attachment with your favorite chatbot or your favorite AI model. As usual. I'm here to have a conversation about this. So if you have any thoughts and opinions, experiences, not just about AI companions and the way you're using them or how you're being how you might be finding yourself being attached, but what I witnessed at Disneyland and California Adventure park, which by the way fantastic memories. Loved all three days. Thanks for the invite Disney. We appreciate it. Any opinions, any thoughts? Reach out to me. Know how to get a hold of me Sunshine. Fm happy to have you part of the conversation. See you again tomorrow.
