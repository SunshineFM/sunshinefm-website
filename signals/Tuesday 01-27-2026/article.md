Hey,

This is Sat. We're talking AI agents that actually work, some very weird corporate theater from tech giants, and why you might want to keep your AI dollars local this week.

## The Weekend That Changed Everything (Maybe)

So here's what hijacked my weekend and basically broke developer Twitter: something called Claude Bot. (That's C-L-A-W-D Bot, not the Anthropic Claude you're thinking of.) Some developer named Peter in Vienna just dropped this open-source thing that finally does what Siri has been promising for a decade—it actually takes over your computer and gets stuff done.

I'm not kidding. Download it, and it starts working across your apps locally. No cloud permissions, no "I'm sorry, I can't do that." Just pure, slightly terrifying digital assistance that works like Jarvis from Iron Man.

This hit me hard because we've been here before. Back in 2015-16, I was knee-deep in voice tech startups, burning investor money trying to build something called AnyChat—basically an email assistant for your Palm Springs to LA commute. We thought voice was going to be the gateway to everything. Two and a half years and a lot of lost money later, we learned the uncanny valley was real.

But this current AI generation? It's finally good enough to bridge that gap. What seemed impossible eight years ago just got dropped on GitHub over a weekend.

## The Weird Corporate Moment We Need to Talk About

There's something strange happening with the big tech companies right now. They're all making these grand AI announcements, but if you look closely, a lot of it feels like performance. Like they're putting on a show for investors rather than actually shipping stuff that works.

Meanwhile, some random developer in Austria is quietly building the future in his spare time and giving it away for free. That disconnect tells me we're at one of those inflection points where the real innovation might be happening in garages and coffee shops, not corporate headquarters.

## Why This Matters for Coachella Valley (And My Soapbox Moment)

Here's my thing: every time we hire an AI consultant from Silicon Valley or pay for services that could be built locally, we're essentially exporting our GDP. I know that sounds preachy, but think about it—if we keep treating AI like some mysterious black box that only coastal experts understand, what opportunities are we creating for our own workforce?

I'm talking to high schoolers at Palm Springs High, students at COD, local entrepreneurs who are quietly experimenting with this stuff. The knowledge is here. The curiosity is definitely here. What we need is more conversation about what's actually working and what's just hype.

(And yes, if you're doing something interesting with AI—whether you're crushing it or completely stuck—DM me. Let's get you on the show.)

## The Music You're Not Hearing Anywhere Else

That track at the beginning? Pure AI-generated indie pop from Udio. British female vocalist, bubblegum pop, 80s-inspired bright synth—all from a prompt. I know some of you hate it (I hear you), but you're literally listening to music that didn't exist until a computer dreamed it up.

Whether that's beautiful or terrifying probably depends on whether you're a musician or just someone who likes discovering new sounds. Either way, it's happening, and Sunshine FM is probably the only place in the Coachella Valley where you'll hear it.

## What I'm Watching

The whole "AI orchestration" thing is about to explode. We're way beyond just writing good prompts now—it's about understanding which models work best for what, how to chain different tools together, and honestly, how to spot the signal through all the noise.

That's my job here, basically. I've got AI agents helping me surface what matters from the 18 hours a day of AI news I definitely don't have time to read. Then I try to figure out what actually impacts us here in the desert, and what's just Silicon Valley talking to itself.

The promise is real, but so is the peril. And this feels like the right place to have those conversations without the corporate polish or the doomsday panic.

Talk soon,
Sat
