1, 2, 1, 2. That was feel the rhythm. And you want. Just being made aware of yesterday. We are playing music that no other radio station in the Coachella Valley is playing. You are listening to Sunshine fm, Modern Media for Palm Springs Coachella. That, for those of you who are playing around with AI generated music, some of the prompts in there that made that one was indie pop, British female vocalist, bubblegum pop, 80s, inspired by bright synth, bass, vibrant percussion, all that good stuff, right? It's. It's pretty amazing what some of these services can actually provide us. Provide us with, okay, Sunshine FM, Modern Media for Palm Strings Coachella. Today is Tuesday, January 27th. And what are we doing here? If you're listening to this, what are we doing here? We're experimenting with AI. We know there's supporters, we know there's detractors, we know the perils and the promise and the pros and cons of AI AI. And if you listen to my TEDx talk that I gave last year, you know, I feel the same way. That said, what I am trying to do here with Sunshine FM is let's talk about AI and what that really means for Palm Springs Coachella. I basically on air go through a whole bunch of my newsletters and the podcast snips that I take out and all the news that's breaking in the last 24 hours, generally in the AI bubble, as it were, AI world, because that's where I live. And I try and surface it to everybody here in Palm Springs Coachella, because at the end of the day, you don't have 18 hours a day to live in the AI world. I don't either. But, you know, at the end of the day, I have an army of agents that help me surface the news and then. And the signal from the noise and as we get better and better at this with your feedback and me, basically, I'm not an on air personality. We all know that. You can send me DMs all you want, but yeah, I'm not an on air personality. What I am is an AI orchestrator. There's a. There's a word of the year for you, I think 2026. Orchestration. AI agents, agent, orchestrator. Yeah, that kind of sounds pretty lame, but basically that's the word that's going to be popping up on mainstream, really. And what that really means is how do we use AI tools and skills? And we're way beyond prompts, although prompt is still a very, very powerful skill to master. Mcps and which models, foundational models might be stronger might be better suited for what you're trying to do. And I help basically surface the signal from the noise and how it actually impacts us here in the Coachella Valley. I'm a big advocate for Coachella Valley to elevate, to help everybody, businesses, next generation workforce, and get ahead of how AI is going to impact all of us. And if you've been listening for the last few weeks, you know that there's a lot of promise and there's a lot of optimistic conversations that I have here. And you also know there is a lot of peril and sometimes some of the tones of the conversations we have here or the news I bring to you, yeah, it's a little bit on the gloomy and doomy side. But the good news is this is the space in the Coachella Valley to have that conversation. So if you've got something on your mind about AI, if you're using it in your business, if you're a founder or an entrepreneur playing around with it, if you're a student in Palm Springs High or cod, reach out. DM me. Let's get you on the show. Tell us what you're doing with AI, what tools you're using, where you're stumbling, where you're like, finding success. And let's learn from each other so that we can also keep the gdp, the AI gdp, within the Coachella Valley. That's the whole. That's the biggest, in my opinion, the biggest impact we have if, if we keep on paying for AI consultants out of the area, what opportunities are we really giving our workforce who are in the area? Again, that's just a personal opinion. Actually, that's not true. That's kind of like my, almost my North Star, right? Internally, Coachella Valley, we need to do better. Let's make more opportunities beyond just the traditional opportunities that we have for high school kids and college grads. And let's see if AI and technology and entrepreneurship all rolled into one is going to be our future. So that was a track you've heard me talk about, Suno. That was actually a track that I got from Udio. Again, you're not going to hear this music anywhere else. Okay, I hear you. Some of you are saying, I don't want to hear this music. I got that. But I'm here to tell you this, Sunshine FM is the only place you can hear this music. All right, so we got a ton of AI news and updates over the last 24 hours. I cannot and doesn't make sense to share everything that happened. But what I can do is I can go ahead and surface what I think is kind of interesting, kind of important that you should know about and where it might, actually might. It could affect you here in what I call Palm Springs, Coachella. So let's start with the one that kind of hijacked the weekend. I touched on it briefly towards the end of my show yesterday, and it's. It's an AI app called Claude Bot. And now it's spelled different. It's spelled C, L, A W, D Bot. Okay. I'm saying that because every time you say this on air, it sounds like I'm talking about anthropic Claude, but I'm not. This is done by a independent developer, Peter. I think he's in Austria. No. Yeah, Vienna, Austria. That's where he is. He spends his time in Vienna and in London. His. It's an app, really, I guess open source hit this weekend, took over the Twitter sphere, took over the developers discord that I'm a part of. And that's all we spoke about this weekend, basically. And if you were online, you probably saw it everywhere. And the reason it spread so fast, it wasn't just hype, it was actually recognition, because people realized that this thing was finally doing what mobile assistants have been promising for more than a decade. It's not about the chatting, it's not summarizing. It's actually doing the work across your apps. And here's the key. Locally on your device without sending everything to the cloud and having to ask for permissions. This is pretty powerful. My software engineer in residence at aicv, he and I've been talking about local servers, local MCP servers, local AI on your device for the better part of six months. This developer comes out of nowhere, drops it over the weekend, and thousands of developers and wannabe developers and creatives and entrepreneurs and idea folks like myself just couldn't get enough of it. It was like, wow, you download this to your laptop, desktop, your device, and it takes over your computer. Yes, scary stuff for sure. But at the end of the day, that is part of the promise that we've been talking about for quite some time. You've been wanting this from Siri, you've been wanting this from your Android. You've been wanting, hey, like Jarvis in your hand. And those of you that may not know, Jarvis was that computer assistant for Iron man, right? It's been a promise forever. It hasn't really materialized. I'll give you a quick little story. Back in the day when voice was the rage and we started a Handful of tech companies and I was on the board of several tech startups, all mo mostly all in the voice activated field which we were building skills for Alexa, we were building assistance for a Google assistant. Siri was kind of a bit of a walled garden, so it's tough to get in there. But we were building all these things because back then, this is 2015, 2016, we actually thought Voice was going to be the gateway, the inter, the, the way we would interact with the Internet as a whole. Now we spent two and a half years in this, sunk a ton of money into that, lost a bunch of investor money as well. The just going across that uncanny valley. However, having said that, AI this current generation and this wow, vastly rapidly improving generation of AI, it is so good with voice. And back in that day we had this fantastic little startup called AnyChat. And AnyChat, its main goal was for commuters. When you're driving from the desert to Los Angeles for your work, basically two and a half hour drive, you would just basically talk to AnyChat and have AnyChat read out your emails in natural language. It will listen to you and get your answers and send it right away. It seems quaint now because all the cars have these talking computers. It seems quaint now because we have a lot of these assistants on our phone. But in 2015, 2016, when we were just kind of using machine learning and natural language processing to understand and to get into your emails and to help you answer the questions that you might have had about the, about that email while you were driving to Los Angeles and back again, that's what we were trying to solve for. We had a ton of POCs and a ton of MVPs. We had a couple that really went well. It just, just, just couldn't find the traction really at the end of the day. So along comes claudebots this weekend and it basically does that. Precisely. The good news is this is open source. So you can go to GitHub and play around with that repository and download it to any one of your devices and, and then start creating skills and actions and tasks for anything you want. Just be mindful. Yes, it's still pretty technical. Yes, you might still need to have some dev chops. You might even need to get a hold of a developer just to help you. This is not for the faint of heart. You know, you are going giving it permission to your computer. But we can see what this really means. I think while I'm talking about it and it's made to you sound novel, I think in about a year, like Christmas of this year, I think a lot of people are going to have all kinds of use cases for this and it's going to be, I wouldn't say second nature, but it's going to be more non technical and it's going to be for mainstream. So keep that in mind. I think this sort of local device AI that basically doesn't chat with you but actually does what you want it to do, like open your emails, do your shopping for you, organize your folders, find that file that's lost in Excel spreadsheets somewhere. That is the promise. And I think that's what claudebot does. Now, having said that, as I said at the top of the hour, claudebot sounds like Anthropic Claude. So just this morning claudebot had to rename itself because Anthropic said, excuse me people, Claudbot sounds just like our Claude code. Could you do something about that? I'm not sure if they were that nice, but let's just pretend they were. Right, so claudebot, which is all about lobsters, right? That's why they call it Claude. The image and the icon, their favicon is on all the lobster. They had to change their name this morning to Moltbot. That's spelled M O L T B O T. And Peter basically says, well lobsters, when they grow, that's what they do, they molt. So we're changing our name to Malt Bot. So if you Google, if you're looking for this on Chat GPT or Claude or Gemini, it's Maltbot. M O L T B O T. These aren't toys anymore. Okay? This is really something that downstream, it's gonna affect a lot of things downstream. If you want to know more about this, you want to talk about it, DM me, get on the show, we'll talk about it. If you want to know how to use it. I think I mentioned this yesterday. We're putting together a couple of boot camps for Bear With Me Now. And this is going to kind of be confusing on air, but we're putting a few boot camps together for Claude Code, Claude Cowork and now Maltbot. They all live in the same universe and they all will help you go from experimenting with AI and just chatting with AI to actually getting things done in your small business, in your enterprise, in your personal startup. Okay, Reach out to us. We'll be happy to take you to the next level on that. I'm trying something you were listening to. Yes, we are Sunshine fm. Yes you are. Modern media for Palm Springs, Coachella, Sunshine. Okay, that was rough. I get it. I haven't set up my MIDI board yet, but I will. What I'm just experimenting with is between stories, I want to go ahead and put a little, I don't know, station ID, interstitial, whatever the professional radio people call it, so you, as a listener can understand. Oh, he's changing subject. So change the subject. A real conversation I had. Someone was asking this simple question. What's the best dictation app to use when your hands don't work the way they used to? And the answers that this person kept getting were the same ones we've been hearing about for 10, 20 years. Dragon built in Mac dictation tools, designed when typing was the only serious way to talk to a computer. I suggested Whisper Flow. Whisper Flow feels different because it's not trying to replace typing. It's basically trying to remove friction. And yes, I know it's an AI tool. I even told her, and I also told everybody else that looks, I know there's pros of AI and there's some cons of AI. Setting that aside, Whisper Flow is basically the best transcription dictation voice tool on the market. You speak and the words appear. And it's not just the words you're saying, it's the words you possibly intended. Okay, that's kind of wild, right? Here's what I'll say. I've been using Whisper Flow since around Thanksgiving of last year, so almost just actually over two months now. Right? Change the way I work with my computer. I use my keyboard very minimally now. Most everything I do is right where I love to be, which is on the mic, on audio, interacting with my computer, just with my words. So it goes from thought to words to the computer, and not through my janky little way of hunt and peck typing, which my son always kind of. You know, I wouldn't say he makes fun of me, but he is brilliant at typing. He'd be typing away, and he'll look over at me as I'm interrupting and he'll carry on typing. He'll be like, yeah, dad, what do you want? I mean, just amazes me every single day. Me, I don't know, I was maybe at 20, 30 words a minute if I really put my mind to it. Now I'm at about 100, 120020 words a minute. I know, tough to believe, but that's where it is. So I told her, whisper Flow, that's for you. I wish I had a affiliate link. Sunshine FM could do with the affiliate links. And as soon as Whistle Flow offers them, I will be offering it to you. And while we think that, you know, hey, look, voice is a novelty and AI is not going to help out in the real world, I'm here to tell you it is absolutely helping. When I told her, hey, listen, I know you got a medical. Medical condition that you can't use your hands anymore as well as you could. Whisper Flow will actually help you. And so this is not about trends, the way I look at it. It's about dignity, speed, and letting people work the way their bodies actually allow. You are listening to sunshine fm. Modern media for palm springs coachella. Sunshine. Thanks, Ronnie. That was great. Okay, again, a bit janky. I get it. I know. I won't go too much into this, but Microsoft just released Maya 2000. I thought it was Maya 200. Bottom line, a chip announcement didn't make a lot of noise, but really should have. I should check what Nvidia stock did, because when Microsoft announced that it made my radar purely because it was all good. There's some competition here. Every hyperscaler is going to realize that renting the intelligence forever is going to get expensive. So we need to either build our own or at least have a contract outside of Nvidia. So when Microsoft build its own chip, it's not really a breakup, it's a negotiation. It's basically saying, look, the outcome of that negotiation shapes who gets to innovate and who has to wait. And Microsoft doesn't want to wait anymore. I'm going to try something here. It's not working. Oh, man. That didn't work either. Okay, no worries. Okay, I'm changing. Changing tack here. We're going to another subject. AI and hospitality. Everyone's using it, nobody's comfortable. That's the headline. Okay. Here in Palm Springs Coachella, obviously, hospitality is one of the biggest industries, right? And the reason why this one's kind of fascinating. There's a report done. Is it exposes the gap between adoption and confidence. A new report shows that nearly all hotel owners, 98% are already using AI in some form. Wow. Really? 98%? For sure. Okay, I don't know about that, but if you're a hotel owner or manager, reach out and DM me. Let me know how you're using AI. That's all of you. But only a third have actually integrated deeply into their operations. Oh, okay, maybe that 98 is just chatting the chat GPT. And they. Then they're on this. They're answering the survey with yeah, I use it. And so I don't think hospitality is any different than a lot of industries. There is a, let's say high use case, but very low actual integration into their operations. So Windham Hotels and Resorts is embedding AI into guest engagement, into pricing, energy management. Basically anywhere humans get tired or coordination breaks down. And that tells you where the real pressure is. Not the novelty, it's the expectations. We know that hospitality margins are on the thinner side, labor is tough and guests always expect personalization without friction. What we've learned over the last year of helping hospitality companies with AI is it's not about replacing people because guest service and hospitality actually requires AI. I mean, actually requires humans. Apologize. I think that was a Freudian spurt, split, Freudian slip there. It actually requires humans. I think the key is how can you empower the humans to be better at what they're doing? Because if you go to any hotel or even restaurant or any service based industry, right now in the valley, apart from the very high end five star creme de la creme, our service is not that great. And if you think otherwise, good for you. You are supremely blessed. The rest of us are having to wait in long lines, long checkout lines in. I wouldn't say rushed, but let's just say indifferent service at restaurants and at the hotels. Well, it's, you know, it's a, especially on Friday check in and Sunday night checkout. It's again, it's. Nothing's changed. I shouldn't say that. Very little changed. AI can actually help Frontline employees do their work better. That's what I think. We've done some consulting where that's actually happening at the end of the day. The reason why it's not necessarily sticking or integrating in a deeper level. It's not a technology issue, it's a cultural issue. And that's one of the boot camps we run. It's about getting everybody on the same page so they can all talk the same language. Okay. Travel planning. The CEO of Expedia Group said that a third of travelers now start planning their trips inside AI platforms like Chat, GPT, Perplexity, Gemini, maybe even, maybe even Claude, but I don't know. He basically said the CEO said they start in the conversations before they even come to Google or a travel site. They would know. Expedia Group has a lot of surface area where travelers book their hotels, their airlines, their rental cars, etc. So he's obviously seeing attribution coming in from the LLMs. Travel planning used to be search driven. Keywords, tabs, filters. Now it's conversational. If you've listened to the show, if you came to our workshop last year, this is nothing new. We've said all along that a lot of our early interactions for wanting to get something done in our own life is not necessarily looking for a search query result. It's more a case of I want to have a conversation with an expert that knows everything about what I'm interested in and then having a conversation back and forth, back and forth and then taking action. It's conversational, conversational commerce. I'm going back to 2015, 2016, because that's what we call it. Back then, conversational Commerce took us 10 years, but here we are. You ask questions, you explore possibilities and reviews become something you query instead of read. I love that. I love that concept. While the five star rating on Yelp and Google and TripAdvisor is not necessarily going to go away soon, mark my words, it's going away. So what does the CEO of Expedia say? He says we're not fighting this shift, we're going to start feeding it. So basically they're turning their Instagram travel videos directly into bookable itineraries. So you're inspired to take action and it's all stitched together without friction. So it's all about loyalty. I think at the end of the day, you heard me say this in the workshops last year, brand messaging, loyalty, that's really what it's going to come down to. Yesterday, no, last week we talked about chat GPT shopping agents and allowing your agents to shop for you and they're kind of shop store. I think it's kind of powered by Shopify right now if I'm not mistaken. And we spoke yesterday about if you're a small business in town. Yes, you're on me. Might be advertising on Facebook, on meta's properties, Instagram most probably. Right. And you might be on YouTube and you might be on travel sites and maybe some out of home. And you may not have been touching base with any LLMs yet. But just know this, at some point you are going to be needing to go in there. Don't wait until your competitors are there. Start experimenting. Now. We ran a couple of workshops last year about this reach out dm. I've got a great team who understand not just marketing but the AI side of things and where things are going. And if you're early enough, get your name to be cited by the LLMs. So Google just came out with universal commerce protocol. It Isn't. It isn't anything that's going to make your. The news feed that you're going to read. But just know this, this is an infrastructural shift. They basically are going to provide a shared language that lets AI agents handle shopping end to end, from discovery to checkout, to support. We talked about this in a previous raid, a previous show. It's pretty soon, maybe more, more than likely this year. But let's just say next year you're not necessarily going to do the shopping for you. I mean, you're not going to do it yourself. You're going to have your agents do the shopping for you. I know it sounds ridiculous. Like shopping online is so difficult. Right? I'll stop right there. It sounds so ridiculous when I say it out loud, but that's where we're headed. Okay? Agents, shopping agents are going to go do all this stuff for you. And so Google's building the infrastructure to make it happen on their side. Okay. And so what it actually does, when you think about this, is almost everything. Almost didn't say everything. The interaction and that interface. You're with Google and Google Gemini, it's already been like a ads place. It's going to turn from an ads place to a storefront. And if you as a local business aren't being cited by Google Gemini either in AI overviews or in AI mode, and you are not, you don't have a website or a shopping portal that allows agents to understand what it is that you offer. Your competitors are going to get there before you and they are going to eat your lunch. And just like everything else with Google, if you're not inside this, if. If your AI agents are not inside this ecosystem, you don't actually disappear because you still exist. You just happen to go downstream and your competitors move upstream and Google's going to take care of it. Oh, unfortunately, Google, OpenAI, Apple, Amazon, Meta, all these big giants, tech giants, they're the ones who are going to decide the winners and losers in commerce. I mean, they always have. I shouldn't say they always have. They have been for quite some time, putting their finger on the, on the scale. This is just going to go next level. Okay. And what we had said last year when we ran the workshops was there's a big difference between being discoverable and being remembered. And the platforms that control the agents tend to control the outcomes. All right, some music right there, please. Do we have any music here? Not really. Oh, that's nice. Sunshine fm. Oh, she said it. Okay. Oh, yeah. That's good. Yeah. Modern media for Palm Springs, Coachella. Oh, I should just keep it with those. Those are nice. Those. Those worked. Hey, thank you. Appreciate that. We talked about AI in Hollywood last week. And here we go. There's a ton of Hollywood folks here in town. I have a couple of my Hollywood friends who live right here in Rancho Mirage. You know, I'm talking about. I've told you, get on the show, let's talk about AI in Hollywood. Get on the show, let's talk about it. I think people will be supremely interested in you and I having a conversation, actually, you, me and my army of agents having a conversation about AI in Hollywood. Okay. A feature length film called get this Brainstare has just been released. It's one of the first publicly available movies generated almost entirely with AI it's not a demo, it's not a short. It's a real narrative feature you can actually watch. Well, this lands right in the middle of an industry still arguing about whether AI is a tool or a threat. He heard me yesterday wasn't, I think so, talking about Scarlett Johansson and others signing a petition. And I kind of chuckled because they got 800 signatures. Okay, whatever. You got directors like James Cameron cautiously experimenting and others like Guillermo del Toro drawing hard lines. And then you've got studios quietly watching the economics. The first AI films aren't supposed to be great. I mean, think about it. Neither were the first talkies, right? We're so spoiled with how movie production is right now. Movies, I mean, storytelling, that's a different story. But movie production, we are so spoiled in terms of how picky we are with special effects and director shots and sounds, etc. Can you imagine the first talkies? Oh my Lord. I think what matters with this release of a full length feature film is that we knew we were going to get to this line, this AI line. And I think possibly this might, we may have crossed that line and into a world that there's no turning back from. Again, my AI Hollywood friends, come on, you know how I feel about this. I'm not all supportive of this, but I do want to see how you're using it, how you've changed, some of you have changed your mind over the last two years from absolutely want nothing to do with it two years ago to yeah, you're, you're figuring out how to use it and you kind of like bits and pieces of it. Let's have a conversation about it and should we finally get a apologize for this term, But AI Studio out here in the desert, where all these great, talented people from Hollywood who no longer have work can maybe work out here in a beautiful place like the Coachella Valley. I'm all about it, especially for your, your state of mental health. One thing that Sunshine FM promises all my friends in Silicon Valley and LA is 350 days of sunshine and less stress than in those cities. Everything else you win on. Okay, but the 350 days of sunshine and blue skies, you don't win on that. We got that one covered. I'd like to parrot what Ben Affleck said last week, which is, yes, the Hollywood making, Hollywood movie making process is being challenged, but creativity itself has not meaning just make good stuff. Basically, what he said, I'm paraphrasing. Okay. And once that happens, the arguments tend to follow the technology, not the other way around. Let's do this again. You're listening to Sunshine fm Modern media for Palm Springs Coachella, you're listening. Okay, again, I don't have a MIDI touchpad hooked up yet. Okay. It'll happen this weekend, but yeah, you're going to get like little station IDs and interstitials to let you know we're moving to another story. Okay. All right, so I've got a couple of bigger, deeper dive stories. We got about 15, 20 minutes to cover this. Okay? So if you're still around, thanks for hanging in there. I promise you the production will get better. It's one human with an army of agents who are doing all the other pieces of it. So bear with me is what I'm saying. Although I don't blame you if you logged off already. But just know this. We play music nobody else plays. And you're getting AI content, I should say AI stories and updates and business radio that nobody else is talking about in the Valley right here on Sunshine fm. I was going to go into that Rebel alliance conversation, but we'll hold that for maybe tomorrow. Okay, so here's something interesting. Sam Altman, you may know who he is right now. He's the CEO of OpenAI. OpenAI is the makers of Chat GPT. He is signaling that OpenAI will grow its headcount much more slowly because AI tools let small teams do more work. But he also says they're not freezing, hiring or eliminating humans. That's PR speak. But having said that, this also fits a broader pattern across AI and tech, where companies are hiring more selectively and cautiously, especially for junior or generic roles. So the upshot for the economy, if there is one, is sure, it's slower job Growth, but that's still job growth, right? I have these conversations all the time with leaders in the cities and the universities locally. And one of the reasons why AICV came to be was how do we arm and empower and train the next generation workforce who are in high school right now, who might be in college, with the tools they need to move into a, a work career of tomorrow, not of ones that are declining, not in industries that are declining. So while there is still some job growth in AI and tech and we, I'm not sure about you, but we're getting conflicting reports about where's the job growth in the US economy, period. We'll leave that for another show. Not mine either. Somebody else's show. It does put more pressure on younger and entry level workers and even career shifters and even older people. Who's really getting squeezed out here? I don't actually say squeeze down because that's not true because I'm, I'm getting kind of conflicting information about that too. But make no doubt a younger generation having a tougher time getting into entry level work because there's this shift towards doing more with less powered by AI. So I often get asked the question, is hiring actually slowing across these industries? And I say, yeah, it is kind of slowing, but it is uneven. And what I mean by that. Here's what I'm seeing from my various colleagues in the industry. AI companies like OpenAI, they're slowing growth, even cutting back. You've read the news in Amazon and Shopify and Microsoft. One of the reasons why they're saying AI driven productivity, but it was kind of happening prior to AI, right? Because they had overhired and now they're just kind of maybe getting banned to basics. I'm not sure about buy that. I think it is AI related mostly, but again, that's coming from me, AI radio station manager. This is giving a lot of companies cover to tighten belts and concentrate hires on core research, infrastructure and product engineering roles. But the good news is startups are growing like crazy. They got the funding, they need to hire more people because even with AI agents, they're moving so fast that they need to hire humans to take on some of these roles. So again, a little bit uneven there. There is a lot of trimming or freezing of roles where AI will automate or substitute for humans. For example, some of the brands that we worked with, customs, customer support, logistics, planning, definitely some back office work. Kind of like what I'm doing with the radio station. A ton of back office work is being done by The AI agents I've created. And by the way, they are not all that either, okay? Some of them are brilliant, some of them are just, just. This is very, very junior, okay? They're like toddlers, man. But this is the whole reason why we're doing this is we're experimenting to see what will work, what won't work. Okay? So in a year from now, hopefully we'll be so much better off in terms of what We've learned over 250 days of on air learning together. 2026 Labor Market Snapshot noted that job postings mentioning AI are growing. I said this last summer when I presented a proposal to the city of Palm Desert and the universities that what we need in town is an AI job board. My engineer partner and myself, we recognize this is where we're headed. We just need an AI job board so we can match folks with AI talent with folks that need AI tasks and roles fulfilled. We're still working on it. It's just, you know, come on, it's been almost a year since we proposed it and as I've said before, very slow activity happening in the leadership class of this wonderful valley. So yes, the US has entered a period of sluggish job creation. Yes, AI is being used as a hiring slowdown tool. And there is a business strategy shift happening right now across every industry. Now what I mean by that is for two years they've been kind of humming and hawing about it. But what I'm seeing over the last few months and going into 2026, I've seen their, seen some of their plans. It's all about prioritizing efficiency and restructuring of existing business models. Now the good news for startups and smaller companies is the big companies, even the mid sized enterprises, they cannot turn that ship quick enough. And if you're a startup founder, if you're a small team locally, you have an opportunity now to capture market share. If you are fast, you're nimble and you understand AI like nobody else does, you can go in and as I say, not just grab market share, but provide something of value. As every company starts looking at how to change their business model. And if, by the way, if you're not looking at how to change your business model and just looking at how AI can help you with, you know, customer service or writing better emails, you are talking a 2023 playbook. We are in 2026 and it's all about innovation. Innovative business models and innovation use cases of all this amazing technology that has been laid at your desk. Sounds Like, I know what I'm talking about because I have this conversation constantly for the last 18 months with, well, you know, my thing. A lot of businesses in town. Oh, go, let's do this. You're listening to Sunshine fm. Thank you, Modern Media for Palm Springs Coachella. That was still bouncing to the next one. Okay, that was a Ronnie. We're gonna play off today, by the way, with a couple more tunes by Ronnie. Hope you enjoyed them. I'm getting some DMS about. Who is this artist? Like I said, you're not hearing this music anywhere else but Sunshine fm. But before I go, I want to leave you with one last story, which I thought was pretty cool. Anthropic, one of the foundational models, LLM companies in the world. They're the co founder, they're the founders of the makers of Claude. Right? We talked about this before. I use Claude constantly in my daily use, in my daily workflow. The co founders, there's seven of them. Dario and his sister, Daniela Amadai, Tom Brown, Jack Clark, Jared Kaplan, Sam McCandlish and Chris Ola. They have pledged to donate 80% of their wealth to philanthropic causes. Oh, come on. I wish I had a little clap button here so I can applause. Is there any applause here? I love it right now. Each founder is reportedly worth around $3.7 billion each one. Seven of them. They're worth about $25 billion in total. And then, you know, they're pledging to donate 80% of their wealth. That's what it's worth now. Claude code isn't going to get any less valuable. It's just going to grow in value. What that, really, what that means at the end of the day is basically, basically a MacKenzie Scott seven times over. Tens of billions of dollars flowing into charitable initiatives. Amadi framed the move as a response to the growing inequality fueled by the AI boom and urged wealthy individuals to act responsibly. Come on, you wealthy individuals. Act responsibly. The pledge also comes with company programs, matching employee donations, signaling. Signaling a broader culture of giving at Anthropic. You know what? I do a ton of volunteer work for CV Giving Day. If you're in the Coachella Valley, you know that CV Coachella Valley Giving Day is the one day of the year where everybody gets together. It's. I think it's in his. Yeah, it's his fourth year this year. They've already raised. They've raised $2 million over the last three years. Where nonprofits. This 24 hour day of online giving, nonprofits register. They activate their supporters, their donors, their board members, their staff and their extended networks to give on that day. And the reason why is because there's about $100,000 of incentive prizes provided by Impact Partners and sponsors of CV Giving Day. And so a small nonprofit can sometimes out of the blue, get a $5,000 prize or a $10,000 prize. And for some nonprofits, that's like a summer's worth of staffing or a summer's worth of rent. So CV Giving Day, it's growing. And when I read this about what Amadi and rest of our co founders are doing with Anthropic. Yeah, I hope he's able to urge a lot of these individuals who are going to be newly minted DECA millionaires and billionaires to be more philanthropic. And yeah, why shouldn't we at CV Giving Day be. Have access to some of this money to give away as prizes for non profits? You know, I just, I'm just thinking out loud. I think we should go ahead. I'm going to say we. I will go ahead and reach out to some of the people I know over at anthropic and at OpenAI and see where they are with this stuff because I think it's a great fit. Yeah, we're not in San Francisco, but that's not the point. We CV Giving Day does great work here locally and it definitely is going to be growing every year. I think their goal this year is a million dollars raised. Oh, by the way, if you want to know more, just go to cvgiving day.org it's on the first Tuesday of every March this year it's March 3rd. I think there's a kickoff this Thursday at Acrisure arena and early giving starts February 3rd. So you have a 30 days a month to engage and activate and start getting your networks going to give on that beautiful CV giving day. And if we can get OpenAI or Nanthropic to be an impact partner. Oh, I think you're gonna, I think you're gonna see this go next level. So I'm gonna leave you with this. In an era when tech wealth often sparks controversy, this decision or this pledge feels like a refreshingly human moment. Leaders behind one of the most influential AI companies choosing generosity over greed. 8020 rule is powerful. I love that their commitment isn't just about money. It's about acknowledging the societal ripple effects of their success and trying to make sure AI driven prosperity benefits more than just shareholders. It's a rare case of Silicon Valley vision meeting genuine humility. Okay, one of my AI agents wrote that. I thought it was pretty cool. And I'm gonna leave you with that beautiful note. I'm keeping track of their pledge of giving Sunshine fm It's your modern media for Palm Springs Coachella. You got questions? You want to talk about AI? You want to talk about small business? If you're opening up a small coffee shop in town, you want to let me know how you're using AI in that opening? Because if you're not, you are leaving intelligence on the table. And as Sunshine FM leads the way in this intelligence layer that we need to create locally, I just want to say thanks. Appreciate you listening. I'm going to leave you with Ronnie, who's one of our first artists on Sunshine FM records, and we'll talk again tomorrow.
