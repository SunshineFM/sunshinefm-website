                                I'm seeing a fundamental shift happening right now that most people in Palm Springs and Coachella Valley are missing. It's not about which AI model is "smartest" anymore. The models—ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini—are commoditizing fast. They're becoming interchangeable. The real competitive advantage is moving to something completely different: orchestration.
                            </p>

                    <!-- Body Content -->
                    <tr>

                                Here's what that means on the ground. When Sat talks about spending his weekend debugging Python scripts that Claude Code wrote, that's not a failure story. That's the actual frontier. He's learning what every successful operator in the Valley needs to understand: AI doesn't replace the work of thinking through your systems. It accelerates execution once you know what you're building.
                            </p>
                            <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0; color: #333333; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7;">
                                The folks stuck in "which model should I pick" paralysis—and Sat mentions enterprises frozen by this exact question—they're solving the wrong problem. You don't pick one. You orchestrate many.

                                Claude releasing Cowork last week signals exactly where this is headed. It's not about coding in a terminal anymore. It's about natural language directing multiple AI agents to handle different parts of your workflow—documents, data, permissions, outputs. This is the pattern we're seeing everywhere: from chatbots that answer questions to agents that own entire process steps.
                            </p>
                            <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0; color: #333333; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7;">
                                But here's the Coachella Valley angle that matters. We don't have 350 workshop attendees ready to deploy this. We have maybe a dozen people actually <em>building</em> with these tools right now. Sat's being generous when he says he "moved the needle" last year. The real story is harsher: most local businesses and even Cal State leadership heard about AI, nodded politely, and went back to doing things the old way.
                            </p>
                            <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0; color: #333333; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7;">
                                Meanwhile, up in the Bay Area, Sat's friends are about to cash out of AI companies as multimillionaires. That wealth, that expertise, that energy—it's going somewhere. The question is whether Palm Springs builds the conditions to attract any of it.

                    <tr>
                        <td style="padding: 0 40px 20px 40px;">
                            <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0; color: #333333; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7;">
                                Let me be specific about what's actually deployable today. Healthcare AI is accelerating faster than people realize. Eisenhower and Desert Oasis should be running pilots right now—not in two years when "regulations catch up." The regulations aren't going to catch up. The Bay Area health systems experimenting today are attracting the talent and capital. The ones waiting will be playing catch-up, probably by acquiring startups built elsewhere.
                            </p>
                            <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0; color: #333333; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7;">
                                SaaS isn't dying, but it's being hollowed out. Sat's example of helping workshop clients drop from $3,000/month subscriptions down to $1,000 because they built their own agents—that's real margin compression happening across the board. If you're a local software company charging subscription fees, you need to understand that your customers can now build 60-70% of your functionality themselves.
                            </p>
                            <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0; color: #333333; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7;">
                                The adoption curve in 2026 will be exactly as uneven as 2025. Probably more so. The people taking action—building, testing, breaking things, iterating—they're going to accelerate dramatically. The people still stuck in conversation mode will fall further behind.
                            </p>

                                If you're running a business in Coachella Valley right now, here's the immediate tactical reality. The AI tools are cheap and available. ChatGPT is $20/month. Claude is $20/month. The bottleneck isn't access to intelligence. It's your willingness to spend 20 hours figuring out what workflows to automate first.
                            </p>
                            <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0; color: #333333; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7;">
                                Most people won't do that. But the ones who do—the ones who build their own agents, even clunky ones—they're going to compound advantages week over week.
                            </p>
                            <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0; color: #333333; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7;">
                                The window is short. The models are commoditizing now. The orchestration layer is where value will accrue. The people who understand that and act on it in 2026 will own significant advantages by 2027. Everyone else will be buying software from them.
