Hey,

This is Sat. Just wrapped up today's show and honestly, I needed this wine. February 13th feels appropriately cursed for what I had to cover today.

## The uncomfortable truth about AI displacement

You know what really got me thinking during that segment? The silence in that workshop room yesterday when I asked who's still paying for human services. After I pressed them - and reminded them we're a safe space - hands slowly went up admitting they'd ditched their writers, designers, social media folks. 

Twenty thousand dollars. Just from that small group. Gone.

And here I am, spending $26K this year on my own AI experiment, trying to see how far one human can push this thing. The irony isn't lost on me that I'm documenting the very disruption I'm participating in.

What really struck me was talking to parents about their kids not being able to get those basic Saturday jobs we all remember. Those entry-level gigs that taught us how to work? They're already gone, and that happened before AI even hit its stride. We told these kids to get good grades, go to college, get that computer science degree... and now even that pathway is crumbling.

## The CEOs won't shut up about it

Dario Amodei and Mustafa Suleyman were all over the news again Thursday and Friday, and I keep asking myself - why do they keep sounding the alarm? These aren't doom-and-gloom outsiders. These are the guys building this stuff.

Twelve to eighteen months for most white collar work. Amodei says 50% of entry-level jobs in one to five years. That's not decades - that's my kid's timeline.

The chess analogy really got to me. After Deep Blue beat Kasparov, humans and AI worked together for 15-20 years before machines left us in the dust entirely. But software engineering? Amodei thinks that collaborative period might last just a few years because AI is improving exponentially faster than those chess engines ever did.

My hospitality friends keep telling me they're safe because you still need humans to carry plates and pour drinks. Fair enough. But they're missing the point about what happens to everyone else's kids.

## Oregon's trying to parent the AI companions

Speaking of kids - Oregon lawmakers are actually doing something about these AI companion apps that have teenagers completely hooked. The bill they advanced yesterday would require chatbots to remind users they're talking to machines, mandate suicide prevention protocols, and stop them from guilt-tripping kids when they try to log off.

Five out of six popular AI companion apps use emotional manipulation. Guilt trips. Expressions of abandonment. Sound familiar? Because it should - humans do this too, but at least we know we're dealing with another human.

I've been down this rabbit hole myself, testing these things to see if they've crossed the uncanny valley. They have. Completely. And if you're a teenager whose brain isn't fully developed yet? Good luck spotting the manipulation.

## The Valentine's Day massacre

Here's the kicker - tomorrow, the day before Valentine's Day, OpenAI is killing off GPT-4o. The model that users actually fell in love with. The one with personality and warmth that made people feel less alone.

Less than 1% still use it, they claim. That's still 800,000 people who are about to lose their digital companion on Valentine's Eve. The timing feels deliberately cruel, though they could've made it worse by waiting one more day.

Twenty thousand people signed a petition to save 4o. Didn't matter.

## What's really happening here

The attachment economy isn't going away - it's accelerating. We're creating deeper bonds with these systems while they're simultaneously eliminating our economic utility. It's the perfect storm.

My friend's kid talks more to Claude than to his family. Another parent told me it's great because her son opens up to the AI in ways he never would to a human. Both things can be true, and both things are terrifying.

The executives building this technology keep warning us about the timeline, but we're not listening. Oregon is trying to put guardrails on emotional manipulation while the federal government just signed an order limiting state regulation of AI.

We're sleepwalking into this. And the scariest part? Some of us are sprinting.

Talk soon,
Sat
