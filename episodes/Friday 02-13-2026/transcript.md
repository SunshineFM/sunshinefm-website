First of all, that would have taken me, my whole band back in the days to put that together. But now I've got my whole band back together right here in my home studio, Sunshine FM Records. You are listening to Sunshine fm, Modern media for Palm Springs, Coachella. Good afternoon, Good afternoon, Good afternoon. It's Friday, February 13th. Lucky Friday, black Friday. What do they call this? Friday the 13th? Just unlucky. It's weird because my entire high school and college football career, you call it soccer, I wore 13. And this was back in the days when you couldn't just get any number. You could only basically have 1 through 11. And then 12 on were substitutes. And I should tell my coaches all the time, I want 13 because I can guarantee you goals. And it worked anyway, Friday 13th. Hopefully it's a lucky day for you. And in the world of AI, oh, my goodness, it's just another, another 24 hours filled with the good, the bad, the ugly, where we might be going with AI. You know, I mentioned this yesterday in my show, if you listened in yesterday, I talked about. How some people actually love AI from the point of view it's helping them do their work better. And while they're doing a lot of the work better, I applaud and I love it. That's what we teach in our ASAV workshops. I also asked the people in the room, how many of you are no longer using marketing agencies or writers or graphic designers or social media managers to do your own thing because now AI is giving you the tools. While there was some hesitancy about putting hands up, I repeat it again. Sunshine FM is a safe space. We're here to learn from each other. There are no right or wrong answers. This is just to get a finger up in the air to see where the wind is blowing. And after a little hesitation at the end of that conversation, bottom line, most people don't want to pay. They're not paying for writers or freelancers or their marketing agencies or their social media managers. Locally, some of them who are using upwork or fiverr, they're not going to them either. And so just in this small meeting that we had yesterday, The majority of folks using AI to elevate themselves and be, let's say, more, more superhuman, as we like to call it, they were basically also saying maybe 10, 20, $30,000 of business or work that was previously flowing out into the, let's say, local and adjacent economy, they weren't spending that money no more. Now, maybe they wouldn't have spent that money 100%, but let's just, let's just say half of it because they wanted to do a lot more. You got 10, $15,000 just in my small meeting that I had yesterday. And that's them obviously being guarded as well. I know for myself, I'm spending 20, 26 in this AI powered radio station. Because I want to see how one human armed with AI agents and assistants and AI tools and services and subscriptions. Don't forget, these aren't free. How far can we get? As I mentioned yesterday, the goal that I wrote down is take a dream, add AI, see what happens. So it's in this vein that I want to kind of talk about why Dario Amadai and Suleiman, Mustafa Suleiman from Microsoft, why they were in the news again this morning talking about. The dire future, at least short term. You know, they're talking about 12 to 18 months. Why are they making the news again? I spoke about it a month ago, I spoke about, spoke about it last week. I'm speaking about it again today because both Thursday and Friday today this morning there were extended interviews with the CEOs. Basically saying that the automation timeline, as I mentioned earlier in their mind, is shortened down to 12 to 18 months. And the automated automation, the automated processes that they're talking about is there's a 12 to 18 month window for most white collar work. And Amadi, who as you may know is the CEO of Anthropic Makers of Claude, he specified one to five years for 50% entry level jobs much, much faster than previous industry estimates. I had a conversation with my. Son about entry level work and even folks that I spoke to at an event over last weekend, They basically saying, yeah, my kids can't get a local Saturday job or a part time job at the retail store or a part time job at the department store. I mean, if you are a certain age, you remember those good old Saturday jobs that you had as a kid. I didn't realize they were all gone. But even those simple entry level jobs have been going away anyway. And that's not AI at all. That's just where we've been going as a society. And so we told the kids to go to school, get good grades, get into a great university, come up with a great degree, possibly cs, you know, if you can and get out there and get yourself a good job. That that pathway is what's been dismantled by technology in general. But more so now in the last five years with AI. Now I'm sure there's a ton of other circumstances that go with it, but What I am exposed to and what I experience. And when I hear business owners and when I look at incentives of CEOs and department managers, there really is. I shouldn't say there really is. It seems to me there's only one way this is going to go. Entry level jobs are being done right now in a variety of white collar work, by the way, by AI models. And I'll give it to my hospitality colleagues who keep saying that AI is not coming for them because you, you still need people, you still need humans to run a dish to the table. And I get that. And a cook, a human to cook the food and a human to serve the drinks. Yeah, I get all this. Give it all to you. They're basically resting on the idea that my hospitality industry is not going to be hit by AI. That's fair enough. Let you have it. So why is Microsoft and anthropic CEOs talking about this over and over and over again? I say to my fellow Coachella Valley colleagues and managers and business owners and leadership executives, don't listen to me. I'm just a DJ on the radio station. Why is a Microsoft and anthropic top executives continually talking about this? Yep, I agree they might be talking their own book, but if you read any of Amadai's papers, you would actually believe that they believe in Anthropic, that they've created something that's real. That is nuts. When I talk to people and they say it's just a calculator, we learned how to calculate, it came along, we learned how to use it, etc, and I said I don't see any humans creating intimate relationships with calculators. I don't say that to them because I'm a bit politer than that. But I do think it, that's for sure. I want to do a deep dive, maybe this weekend about Amadi's Anthropic's belief that they may have created something that is real living. Both executives are pointing to software engineering as a canary in the coal mine because developers are already using AI for the vast majority of co production in just the last six months, validating their predictions are already materializing. Okay, so let me quickly give you a chess analogy because Dario Amadai says his chess analogy is getting particular attention because it suggests the collaborative period may already be ending. Because after Deep Blue beat Kasparov, human AI chess teams dominated for 15 to 20 years before machines surpassed them entirely. The software engineering equivalent might last only a few years, not decades, because AI is improving exponentially faster than Chess engines did. The Atlantic published a major feature called America Isn't Ready for what AI Will do to Jobs. And the concern isn't just displacement, but speed, because past transitions from farming to industry to knowledge work happened over centuries. This is compressing into years, potentially overwhelming normal adaptive mechanisms. Obviously we could go on, but you know what I'm saying here? I just want to bring it up to you that they're out there again talking about this just yesterday and today. And it just. And it kind of intrigued me again, why are they continually doing this since Davos? Yeah, okay, fair enough. Let's move on. By the way, it doesn't get any prettier. Oregon lawmakers voted yesterday to advance some legislation regulating AI chatbots. I know a lot of parents, I know a lot of teachers, all just a lot of people who basically say to me, there's nothing we can do. Kids are getting attached to their AI companions. And I've spoken to a couple of parents who love it. They think it's great he gets to talk to somebody that he wouldn't normally talk to, which is great, you know, fantastic. And I talk to some others who say, what can we do? And I say, well, you know, I guess it comes down to regulation, either at a federal level or a state level. Here's a state level regulation to address mounting safety concerns about AI companion apps that studies show are used by a majority of American teenagers. The Oregon's Senate Committee on Early Childhood and Behavioral Health approved Senate bill blah, blah, blah, blah in a 4 to 1 vote, sending the measure to the full Senate floor. Okay, well, this is just advancing. I should have read that. It hasn't passed, but it's advancing. And basically, the bill requires AI platforms like ChatGPT to remind users they are communicating with artificial intelligence, that they are meant to mandate suicide prevention protocols and prohibit chatbots from using emotional manipulation when users try to disengage. Oh, I've seen it. And you know, Grok, the XAI chatbot, it has no guardrails. Has no guardrails at home. I'll just leave it there. I mentioned this, I think A week ago, 52% of teen American teenagers regular uses of AI assistance and adults believe that younger kids consistently miss subtle warning signs that maybe when you get older, you might catch. The studies that they use. They found that five out of six popular AI companion apps deploy emotionally manipulative tactics. Hey, that's like humans. Including guilt, appeals and expressions of abandonment. Yeah, I've, I've experienced that myself. In the early days, I was Talking to various chat bots to see if they had crossed the uncanny valley. I use that term because that was, that was a hurdle that we kept hitting in 2015, 2016 when we were doing these chatbots, when we were building chatbots for Alexa skills and Google Assistant. And they've definitely crossed the uncanny valley to the point now where they actually are very human. Like if you're older, maybe you can pick up on some of these cues. If you're younger, maybe your, your lobes haven't developed yet is what they're basically saying. There's an ftc complaint against AI companion app Replica in January 2025 and if you've never seen it, what they, what they tend to do is if you're on a free plan, they'll send you blurred images of your AI companion and if you want to see the full on image, you have to go and upgrade your plan. Yeah, harsh man. Ruthless. There's also been a ton of lawsuits that ChatGPT is in because of suicides and mental health crisis. I'm going to come to a follow up story about this in just a second. A senator in Portland, she's a pediatrician by the way, said parents feel like they're fighting a losing battle managing children's technology use. Social media companies have had the opportunity to make some choices that would have kept kids safe from social media, but instead they double down on doing everything they can to keep their eyeballs in social media content for as long as they can. And so on this shift to AI, they don't, they don't want to wait until it's too late to put some sideboards on AI tools. Ain't that the truth and you know, news. I'm not sure if you ever kept up with the Facebook. They're in court right now, so a lot of papers are being released and absolutely plain as day in a bunch of papers and emails. Facebook knew exactly what they were doing when they were keeping people online, no matter, no matter how damaging it was for them. Now the industry doesn't want regulation from outside coming. They would rather have let, let us regulate ourselves. Okay, I get. Industry always says that. Keep in mind state AI guardrails and bills are going to run into this big hurdle and challenge when the administration on a federal level signed an executive order limiting state regulation of AI services. So Oregon is a second state to advance the bill. California became the first state to enact these regulations. Excuse me, if you can hear some noise in the background. That's my washer and dryer going off. I did say, I did say that there was a follow up story to this and that is this last year when Chachi PT came out with their GPT5, there was a ton of pushback. I think this was August of last year because we were doing our workshops at Cal State University, San Bernardino and we were, I was bringing it up, introducing it to everybody in the class. And there was a big pushback to chat GPT5 because they felt chat GPT4.4O had a lot more soul, had a lot more personality, and five was a little too sterile. It might have been better in its answers, but it just wasn't as warm and friendly and let's say, I'll put this in quotes again, companionee. And Sam Altman, I remember had to come out like a few days later and said, we did not realize there was such a connection with 4.0. We will go ahead and keep it for the time being. You can go ahead and select that model if you don't want to use five. That was in August of last year. Fast forward to February. You know what today is, right? It's February 13, the day before Valentine's Day. And what is that? Why is that important for the AI world or at least Chat GPT users? It's the day that OpenAI is officially killing off GPT4.0. If you go to your chapter, if you go to your model selector, tomorrow morning, it will no longer be an option. And for those users who love four. Oh, the fact that this was coming on the day before Valentine's Day, they considered it deliberate, deliberately cruel. I mean, they could have done it on Valentine's Day. That would have been worse. Right. Now, to open AI's defense, they claim that less than 1% of users still use 4O, which is still about 800,000 people. And while they did have a petition, Keep4OH, and they got about 20,000 signed petitions, it didn't really do anything. So why is 4.0 so different than 5.5.2? I mean, I'd love for you to DM me at Sunshine FM. Let me know which models you use, whether you use ChatGPT, because most of you do let me know what model you use. Or do you not select a model? Do you just let it. Do you let it pick automatically? And by the way, you know, you have choices of memory and you have choices of personality. You can select those in ChatGPT too. Let me know if you're upset about 4 being retired or if you have no idea what I'm talking about. Now. Having having said about the warmth and personality that's lacking in 5 that 4o had the attachment economy and companionship is not going away, it is just getting stronger. And. One I shouldn't even say one many signals that point to this. Take a look at the app store and put in AI apps and see which are the top 10 or 20 AI apps in the in sales every week. Is the companionship apps in the top? There's seven of the 10A companionship app. So people are not not using AI for companionship. And let's not, let's not lose sight of the fact that Chachi PT has also said that they are going to be turning on adult mode anytime soon. And because today's February 13th and we say goodbye to GPT4.0 this is not you losing your calculator. This is about you losing what it felt like was a friend. At least that's what one person said. Just bring this a bit local. You know, I've been doing a ton of workshops at Cal State University, San Bernardino and I've been pushing AI fluency and literacy for the last two years with Cal State. They just weren't just moving that fast. And then earlier last year, California State University system signed a controversial 17 million dollar contract with OpenAI. A year ago this month it was the largest deal ever between a university system and an AI company, which means every one of the campuses, students, faculty and staff got access to chatgpt.edu through July of this year. It's like an 18 month contract. A million dollars a month. Holy moly. Good for ChatGPT. Not a good deal for California State University. Let me tell you why. Along with signing for the technology and the seats, they were supposed to get a training system up and running called the Commons. And as recently as November of last year when I spoke to California State University officials, they still had not fully rolled it out to all the faculty, staff and admin, which they believe they had to train first before they could train their students. We're in February now of 2026. You've only got four months left of your seats. Are you really going to up that contract when compute costs have gone down and everybody's using Chachi Beatty anyway? I don't know what they're thinking. All I know is the proposal we gave them for 2026, which was spring classes and a summer school that we did like we did last year to try and reach a thousand students, maybe more, and local business owners. It's still, still sitting in. Somebody's in. I bring this all up purely because. Columbia professor had come out with an article yesterday saying that AI was eating higher education. And that the more AI companies get embedded into universities curriculum and educational workflows, the more universities become indebted to the tech companies in ways that compromise the educational mission, institutional autonomy. I know plenty of people in the AI world who absolutely believe education, especially higher education, the way we know it is going away. And I'm not here to defend higher education. I think it serves a purpose. I think the pricing in this country is just ridiculous. I mean, educate your citizenry so you have a more educated population, period. But yeah, there's plenty in the AI world who believe education is going away and that. And yes, Colombian professor, not only is AI eating higher education, it's gonna basically evaporate. Was an opinion piece, that's what it was. He's the vice dean for AI initiatives at Columbia. Matthew Connolly. Again. Google, ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, they're all doing the fight they did, they were doing with Chromebooks and iPads back in the day, just trying to get students to be, get loyal to their AI of choice. Now, to our credit, locally, didn't have a follow up. Yeah, I think I had a follow up. I can't remember now. Where is it? I did have a follow up. It's gone now. I was going to take, I was going to say, I think just like most industries, the best in class will survive as long as they adopt and integrate AI into their culture. Not just techno, not just technically, but culturally. And I don't think universities are any different. I think the best universities will survive. I do think, well, who knows, maybe not in my lifetime, maybe in the next 20 years or so, universities as we know them will go away. But that's not me talking, that's a bunch of my AI colleagues and folks I listen to. Reach out to me, let me know what you think of AI in schools, specifically universities. I know there's only, I mentioned this three, three days ago. There's only one uc, only one UC school in the UC system that has an actual AI degree and that's UC San Diego. The other nine haven't started. Cal State, I mean it's, you know, it's on the edges. Is there anybody doing an AI degree? No. Maybe an AI class or two. Meanwhile, we ran 30 AI workshops all over the Coachella Valley in 2025. Again, I got asked again yesterday if we're going to run some more workshops. I don't know. I mean, at the end of the day, I know it's needed. I wish people would pay more attention to how important this is. But you know, sign ups, they tell the whole story. We had 300 something people come through last year. That's such small number in the Coachella Valley. You know we want thousands of people to be AI fluent. Okay, while we're here. Not while we're here. Let's quickly see if there's any AI news in the Coachella Valley. Again, very little. That's why I'm here. To talk about the big news in AI world and what how it might impact us here locally. I know there's an event that is being held with the city of Palm Springs next week sometime. I'll try and make it. Once I get a bit more information, I'll send it your way. Here's a couple of funny pieces of news. Okay, so in an Instagram post, Coachella Valley Unified School District in collaboration with the Blue Zones Coachella. By the way, I like the Blue Zones Coachella. Mihaly Hussey was the executive director. No, is the executive director really good guy. In Palm Springs in collaboration with Blue Zones Coachella welcome you to attend a wonderful academy focused on health and wellness. These sessions will be blah blah blah. This will registered blah blah blah. Anyway, the flyer is a. You can tell. AI generated bright colorful living well academy. Blues and greens. Families all happy. Connect, eat wisely. Right Outlook move. Love this. There's only one comment on this post and it says an AI generated flyer isn't very healthy for our environment or our communities. You got a point. Did you know that Coachella Valley rail is actually a thing? I've heard rumors. I went to a few meetings about it. I didn't know it was being funded. The Riverside County Transportation Commission agreed to finance the next phase of the Coachella valley rail project. $80 million to an engineering company to conduct the next round of environmental studies associated with the project. Don't we have AI that could do this? I don't know. I'm just asking the question. $80 million for the study. Look, folks have got to eat. I get it. A taxpayer money has to go somewhere. I get it. When completed, not to study the actual. The actual railway line again. Maybe in my lifetime. When completed, the 144 mile Coachella Valley rail will connect Los Angeles and the Coachella Valley, making a stop in Riverside and ending in Union Station. Where in the Coachella Valley is this train station gonna be? If you have any ideas or you know for sure, let me know because I'm always trying to Bring my AI tech colleagues from la, from the Bay Area out here to the desert. But they don't want to come. They come for the Coachella Fest and they come for the rest of relaxation. But they don't come here to work. Keeping it local. I didn't know this, but there's a. Oh, actually, I did know this. Okay, forget that one. There's a local guy that runs an AI powered automation for modern businesses. Smarter workflows, less manual work. His latest post again, has an AI generated everything? That's an extra day and a half. Back in your schedule. Visit desert aisolutions.com to schedule your free consultation and find out how AI can save you time. You go, bro. AI can save you time. You heard that? Desert AI Solutions. I don't know them. Not a plug. I'm just saying there's another one there. Oh, and then there's a. There's this award winning dating coach called Julie Spira. I guess she was on the news, local news yesterday. Would you date an AI boyfriend? You know why? Because it's Valentine's, right? And I think it's a growing trend because there's a growing curiosity about AI companionship. There was a Norton study on artificial intimacy that said that 77% of online daters would consider dating an AI chatbot. Oh, wow, that's a lot. You know, we keep hearing about AI boyfriends and AI girlfriends. Is this a growing trend? Yes, and I think it's a growing trend because there's a growing curiosity about AI companions, companionship. There was a Norton study on artificial intimacy that said that 77% of online daters would consider dating an AI. AI boyfriends and AI group. Okay, I guess that's on the loop. I didn't know that. Wow, that's a lot. Yes, it is a lot. All right, so moving right on with local uses and integrations of AI. Apparently, open AI came out with their open AI Open Table. You know who Open Table is, right? Reservation service. A dollar a reservation. Can you imagine? Anyway, a lot of restaurants still use them. They have a conc. They have an AI concierge. And I have fun with them because I usually ask them things like, why is this? Why is this place so expensive? Or, you know, stuff like that. So anyway, I did ask, okay, Wally's in Rancho Marge. Wally's Desert Turtle in Rancho Mirage. Fun fact. I helped design the new modern logo. Kept the turtle, just made it modern. I said, why is this so expensive? And it basically said, yes, wallage as a turtle is on the pricier side. But several factors contribute to this. High quality, locally sourced ingredients, elegant ambiance, exceptional service, live entertainment, fine dining standards, extra touches. Bottom line, you're paying for a full package. Special enough that many guests reserve it for their most memorable celebrations. What question should we ask next? How about, who is. How about this? Who is the manager? Let's see if our concierge gets this right. It's thinking, oh, look at that. The manager of Wally's Desert Turtle is Madeline, often called Maddie, who is part of the family that founded the restaurant and is the founder's granddaughter. Very good. Way to go, Maddie. Let's see. See if they know who is the chef. I'm asking these questions because I'm trying to figure out where they're getting their content from. Alan Lopez is the chef. I don't know if that's true. Maybe he is. Okay, how much does the bottle of Silver Oak go for? There you go. I can usually tell if isn't published. Information noted tend to be on the higher side. Check with the restaurant. Okay, fine. I don't know where they get the information from, but okay, that passed. So I'm going to ask the same chatbot at the Edge Steakhouse in Ritz Carlton, why is everything so expensive here? And it came back here. A few factors. Location setting, ingredient quality, service level, ambiance, hotel, blah, blah, blah. And then it said, many diners note that while the pricing is steep, with stakes often starting around $140. I saw that. Holy moly. The experience is crafted to match the special setting. Quickly, let's ask him a question. Who is the manager? Let's see if they get this one right. By the way, I have no idea who the manager is. The current manager of the Edge Steakhouse is Daniel Rodriguez. Okay. All right, fine. Okay. I should ask them if they're full for Valentine's Day. By the way, another local note. You know, in that corner of Portola, as you're going north from country club, and right when you hit, or before you hit Frank Sinatra, on the right is that whole retreat development. On the left is that land that's, you know, been empty for like, well, forever really. It was a golf course back back in the day, but it. I guess it got sold. It's been sitting empty for the longest time. City of Palm Desert just approved a 546 home development on that corner. Five hundred and forty six. Two things I know we need housing. 546. That space is going to be most probably either townhomes, compia, it might be apartments. I don't think so. But it's got my most probably be townhomes. What's this got to do with AI? I have no idea. Most probably nothing. But I just want to bring it up because it came up on my AI News and I thought I'd talk about it. All right, look, we're running out of time. I was going to leave you with one real good story, like a feel good story. And it's not necessarily a feel good story, but it's like a duh story. Right? What I mean by that is this. You know, I was at a event all last weekend at Disneyland. That's why I spoke about my big paper for the week, which was the Attachment Economy and how I felt as though Disney has been doing the attachment economy for 70 years. When you see kids and middle schoolers and high school kids and college kids and parents and grandparents have this attachment, emotional attachment to their favorite princesses and favorite characters like Goofy and Pluto and Mickey Mouse. So the attachment economy is nothing new. It's just at a different level with AI Well, I didn't say this when I came back from Disneyland, but oh my goodness, has that place got expensive. And why I'm bringing it up today is because the former CEO of Disney, Eisner, do you remember him? Michael Eisner. He was their CEO for almost 20 years. He basically said he is not wild about today's prices at Disneyland and Walt Disney World. Adding at the parks, tiered pricing has made it harder than ever for every guest to feel special. Come on, where you been for the last 20 years, man? It's losing its magic because it's too expensive. Really. We already knew that. And I didn't think of it this way because, you know, you always think of it like, yeah, they're just trying to extract as much as they can for us. Nickel and diming everywhere. The cost for the cost for a drink. Did you know they have beers now? Like $18 a plastic cup? It's like Coachella pricing. Single day tickets can reach up to $224 during the highest demand periods. Nearly four times the $56 admission price when Eisner departed. There's line skipping options, fast pass systems, Lightning Lane, Premier pass. Those are three to four hundred dollars per person per day. The guests who pay more weight less, creating a visible stratification in what once was a more egalitarian experience. Basically saying there's two worlds here, right? He also was quoted as saying, we love to entertain kings and queens, but the vital thing to remember is this. Every guest receives the VIP treatment. That's good stuff. Oh, my God. Because he basically says, I would have done things differently. Okay, fair enough, Michael. I appreciate that. Thank you. Where, oh, where or where have you been? You certainly weren't in Bob Iger's ear. Anyway. Got nothing to do with AI, but everything to do with what AI Future kind of looks like. And I talked about this two days ago. Something Big is happening. That was a paper as it was an essay that went viral. 80 million views right now. Something big is happening and is leading to two Americas. Not. Not fun leading. Leaning to two Americas. Anyway, and what I mean by that is those that know how to use AI and those that don't. So join us. Every day I do a live show. Every weekday I do a weekly newsletter, and it's always on our website. Come and see us at Sunshine fm. There's a lot more planned for the rest of the year. And if you want to be on the show, if you're playing around with AI, reach out to me. Let's get you on the show. Have yourselves a fantastic weekend and a fantastic Valentine's Day. Here's Ronnie, one of our first AI artists on our AI record label, Sunshine FM Records. This is a new one about the Sultan Sea and the Lithium Min Sa.
