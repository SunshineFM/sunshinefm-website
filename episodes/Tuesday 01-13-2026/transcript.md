# Transcript: Tuesday 01-13-2026

Foreign. O', clock, Tuesday, January 13th. This is Sunshine FM Modern Media for Palm Springs Coachella. Hey, everyone, this is sat, founder, dj, program manager, radio station operator of Sunshine fm. All right, so we're going to try something new today in this experiment. If you've been listening so far, you know that Sunshine FM is purely an experiment. An experiment to connect one human, and that's me with an army of agents, co hosts, AI assistants, AI tools and services together, working together, collaborating together to see if it's possible to fulfill some of the promises that AI seems to throw out there on a daily basis. Experiment that we're doing at Sunshine FM is can me, a single simple individual, actually launch and create a radio station? Now, putting that quotes, because radio stations are tough businesses. They require a ton of people to manage operations, sales, on air, personalities, etc. Etc. And this experiment is to see a radio station has always been a dream of mine, ever since I was a kid. And now I'm kind of doing two things. I love radio, music, that whole industry, and what AI promises to be in the future. So as we as the world basically speeds into the world of AI and Palm Springs Coachella saunters into this world. That was a bit of an opinion. Yes, I get that. We're going to try a new segment today and the segment is called Connecting the Dots and the Format. So stick with me, if you don't mind, is is I'll pull up a topic or two that I think are kind of important over the last usually 24 hours, but in this case it'll be over the last few days. And as. And rather than me try and answer all the questions that seem to come up in the topic that I present, I'm going to evoke one of the agents that I've built and its name right now is IO I O. Obviously a mechanical, electrical engineering and computer language term. And the reason why is this because you've often heard me refer to myself as a jack of all trades, master of none. And I thought, what would be a great co host, even if it's just a robot, is how about we flip that and get a master of all trades? And that's what IO is. It is a master of all trades. I'm having difficulty with that. I want to call it he. But remember, don't name your robots in your computers, just know what they are. So IO I'm going to go ahead and set up the topic of the day and then I'm going to ask the questions that I have on my mind to IO live in on my web browser and whatever answers it comes back with, I'll read them on air. Okay? Right now, IO doesn't have a voice. We have played around with it on 11 labs, but it'll take a while before it's kind of, let's say, ready for prime time. Although, having said that, everything we're doing here is not ready for primetime at all. This is an experiment. These are POCs. These are MVPs. Place as a newsletter goes out at the end of the week to recap what we've talked about all week long. DM reply to that email with any questions and comments, and I'll be happy to read them on air following days. So here we go. You are listening to Sunshine FM Modern Media for Palm Springs Coachella. Today is Tuesday, January 13th. Connecting the dots so here's what's been on my desk this week. Paul Rotzer or Reitsa, I'm not sure how you pronounce that. Sorry. Paul said something on episode 190 of the AI show that stuck with me. He basically said, we don't need to reach AGI, however you define it, to completely transform business, the future, your work and your own work. It's a simple sentence with a big implication. And here's. Here's what I mean by that. Everyone's been obsessed with when the God model arrives. The questions when do we hit AGI? When does everything change? Last week I heard someone tell me AGI is going to be here in six months. A couple of months ago, folks were saying it's five years. So this moving target that everyone's chasing, it feels like it's become a distraction. And here's what I'm seeing, not just in the data from the podcast and the newsletters that I subscribe to and from my own contacts in the AI world, but also the work I've been doing for the last, let's say, 18 months to two years here in Palm Springs Coachella. The transformation isn't necessarily waiting for AGI. It's already happening. Claude Code is shipping, Gmail is adding AI. We've got agents, we've got agentic commerce. We have billions of dollars being invested into hundreds, hundreds of companies and the startup ecosystem, not just in Silicon Valley, but globally, is like, it's so overwhelming that you can't really keep up with it. And while everybody's kind of waiting for AGI, I think the real bet is is on useful capability today. So what I want to dig into is I want to ask IO remember, remember, he's Our master of all trades to help connect these dots. Because if the podcast and the newsletters I'm reading are right, then the question isn't, when will AI change my business? The question should be, why am I not using it right now? So as we get ready for the first question, I'll pull up the agent. Okay, and here's the question I'm going to feed into IO, okay, so if the AGI obsession is a distraction, why is literally everyone still hung up on the finish line? What's the psychology that's at play here? Okay, so that's the question. And by the way, if you're not hearing typing, that's because I use voice to do all my typing. And right now I'm at about 138 words per minute. Happy to share what I use. It's. After all, I'm an affiliate for them, so I'll be happy to share my code at the end of the day. Today's show. So here we go. So IO basically replied with, so you're saying the finish line is easier to talk about than the actual race that's happening right now? I get it. It's cleaner, it's more dramatic. AGI is coming, sounds better than AI, is incrementally useful across more domains every month. But here's what I'm hearing underneath that. The people who are winning right now aren't the ones waiting, they're the ones moving. They're the ones asking, how do I use this today? Not when will this be perfect? You know, I think it's a great response by IO because it mirrors what I've been witnessing and experiencing for the last 18 months to two years myself, right here in Palm Springs Coachella, because the leaders of all the organizations and let's say, cities and councils that I've been speaking to, what they're saying today at the start of 2026 is exactly what they were saying, basically the end of, you know, 2023, start of the 2024. So in my experience, two years, and they're still basically saying, we're just waiting for what? HR sign off, legal sign off, security sign off. They're waiting for things to be better, more perfect. Meanwhile, there's a whole bunch of entrepreneurs and AI curious experimenters that we've been, let's say, working with all last year. We, you know, we ran about 30 workshops at Cal State. They're just moving. They're just not waiting for permission. They're going out there and experimenting. And when anybody comes to me and asks me how Do I get started? I basically just say, just pick one chat GPT or Gemini or Claude, my anthropic, and just start experimenting. It's what I'm doing with this radio station, Sunshine fm. It's just an experiment. I urge you to and encourage you to do the exact same thing. You can listen to all the YouTube videos you want. That's great. But right now the best thing to do is just start seeing what works. And what kind of is a little bit of a disappointment locally is we seem to be in kind of this kind of resort mentality is what I'm hearing. By the way. Those are other people's words. And my fear is that we're just going to be left behind like usual. But anyway, that's a different point. So I think what IO says here is basically very important, is how do I use this today, not wait for this to be perfect? And AI should be a multi disciplinary advisor. That's the exact framing we think people are missing. Okay, so my next question would be then, what does multidisciplinary advisor actually mean in practice for someone here in Palm Springs Coachella, running a business, a restaurant, a real estate brokerage, a marketing agency. What does that look like on a Tuesday morning? What's the concrete move? Okay, so that's my question to IO and his I O. It didn't take long. Okay, so IO responds with. Hang on one second. Didn't quite respond there. Let me go ahead and do it this way. Actually, I thought I had it this way, but I don't. That's okay, give me a second. Because I made this more local, the response might be slightly different. Okay, so here's IO's response. That's a sharp question. It cuts right through the theoretical AI hype and land squarely on the desk of a business owner here in the Valley. When we're talking about a multidisciplinary advisor, we're not talking about a new piece of software you need to buy. We're talking about a shift in how you use the tools you already have, like Claude or Gemini or ChatGPT. Here's what this might look like in practice on any given day in Palm Springs Coachella. Okay, remember, I'm reading this out live, so while I may not agree with it, let's just see what Aya comes back with. For a real estate broker, the investment strategist, the scenario is you have a client looking at a commercial property on Palm Canyon Drive. You know the vibe and the location, but you aren't a tax attorney or A structural analyst. The real movement. You upload the preliminary lease agreement and the last three years of property tax data to your AI and the prompt is, you are my senior commercial real estate strategist and tax advisor. Analyze this lease for hidden escalation clauses and compare the tax history against current Riverside county trends. Summarize the top three risks I should flag for my client before our 11 o' clock meeting today. And the transformation should be, you aren't just a broker anymore. You are providing high level decision intelligence that would normally require a 500 an hour consultant. Okay, that's pretty. But first of all, for those of us in the AI world, that's pretty like table stakes. If you're new to AI, absolutely. This is the sort of way you want to start collaborating with AI to help you together move forward in what you're trying to do. Keep in mind, most people will struggle with what we call one shotting. They expect perfect answers right away. And they're not going to get that until you start iterating both on the model you're using and how you prompt it and how you keep memory in place and how you what format you want. So there's a lot of kind of work you got to do behind the scenes. But again, that's where you start experimenting today. Now, IO also came up with a whole bunch of similar answers for the restaurant owner and a marketing agency. And so my kind of response to that would be as something along the lines of we're basically filling gaps, right? We're using AI to access expertise we don't have in house. And that's way different than replacement. That's. You know, I think there is a fear about replacement. And don't get me wrong, I, I'm a little fearful myself about what this means. But for right now, how do you collaborate with AI? Right. The accountant isn't going away, but do we really need to hire an accountant for the preliminary analysis anymore? If we can get 80% of the insight in 20 minutes, then we can have a real conversation with the expert, the human Expert, about the 20% that requires that person's real expertise. And that changed the game for a solo entrepreneur and a small business owner. That's the huge takeaway from this first portion. The other thing I want to kind of add to this whole conversation is these aren't just helpful tools. I hear a lot of people say, oh, these are just a tool. Well, I don't know. I think they're more than just tools. This is not just a hammer, right? This is A playbook. This is a strategy. This is. You're working together. It's almost like this is in infrastructure. And I think this is much more powerful than just a tool now, happy to be corrected. If other people feel otherwise, just reply to the email that goes out in the newsletter and I'm happy to have that conversation. This is. This experiment is a safe space for all sides of opinion about AI. Okay, so here's in my next question. My next question is, here's what I'm wrestling with. If we don't need AGI to transform everything, why is capital flowing so fast? Why is Xi Xai raising billions? Why is Anthropic raising billions? Why is OpenAI continue to raising billions? And why is every major company racing to integrate AI agents into their system? What's the real signal underneath? Well, let's put this into IO. Let's see what IO says on this one. Okay. IO says, because the market has already figured out what the academics are still debating, the capital isn't flowing to AGI, it's flowing to usefulness at scale. That's interesting. It's a bet that there's massive immediate revenue in AI that helps people think and work faster right now. And here's the signal. Every major company is racing to integrate AI agents because they've already seen the gap. The gap between what one human can do and what one human plus AI can do. And that gap is where the money is. Oh, wow, that's interesting. Okay, I haven't thought of it that way. Actually, maybe I have thought of it that way. I've just never verbalize it that way. The gap is where that money is. A restaurant owner using Claude to redesign their operations saves 50,000 a year immediately. A real estate team using AI to analyze markets cuts research time by 80%. That's not AGI. That's just leverage. Interesting. So the real insight is that competence is becoming a commodity. The companies winning aren't the ones with the smartest people anymore. I might push back on that. Although, I don't know, maybe they're the ones who figured out how to orchestrate people plus machines, which is kind of what I'm doing here at Sunshine fm. And that's a solvable problem today. We don't need AGI for that. You just need the infrastructure to be built fast enough before everyone else figures it out. So. So here's the dot to connect capital flows to solved problems, not theoretical ones. Okay, I wasn't aware of that. AGI is theoretical. Practical AI agents that increase productivity by 30 40%. That's solved. That's shipping right now. And that's why the money is moving. Wow. Okay, so basically, it's not betting on AGI, although I would talk to some VCs who are. Is betting on usefulness, on the fact that these tools are actually solving problems today. And that's the signal. But here's where I want to get uncomfortable for a second because I keep hearing from people, and I'm sure you've heard this too, I keep hearing, if AI can do my job, am I obsolete? That's the real fear, isn't. Isn't it? It's not the AGI is the fear. It's just replacement is the fear. Okay, so I know this format's new. It's a little bit kind of rocky for me as well, because I'm kind of learning how to read what my agent is telling me. In. In the future, we'll have IO actually speak their responses to. Okay, so here's my fourth question. If the tools are already shipping, if the transformation is already happening, does the human just become obsolete, or does our role as humans actually become more valuable? Here's IO's response. Tell me if you agree or disagree on this one. The human becomes the filter. Right now, most work is linear. You do task A, then task B, then task C. Each one requires your judgment, but they're sequential. They're constrained by time. They're bound by what one person can hold in their head. But when AI can do task A, B, and C in parallel and synthesize them, the bottleneck shifts. The bottleneck becomes which of these 50 options is actually the right move. That's judgment. That's taste. That's the stuff that requires human intuition and context that machines can't replicate. So the human doesn't become obsolete. The human becomes more valuable, but in a different way. You're not the executor anymore. You're the decision maker, the taste maker, the one who says this matters, this doesn't. Here's the direction, but. And this is crucial, that only happens if you actually embrace it. If you're still trying to be the expert who knows everything, you're going to get run over. But if you're willing to say, I don't know this, but I know who to ask, and you're willing to ask fast, iterate and make decisions, you become ten times more valuable. The people at risk aren't the ones AI can theoretically replace. They're the ones waiting for permission to move. They're the ones choosing to stay in the old model, while the world shifts around them. So here's the dot to connect. Obsolescent isn't. Obsolescence isn't about capability. It's about adaptability. The people moving win, the people waiting lose. Whoa. Okay. So that framing, while not maybe I don't agree 100% with it, I do think it's a framing that people need to hear. This is SAT speaking, by the way. It's not that AI replaces you. It's that AI changes what your job is. Now, I'm seeing that in my clients in LA and San Francisco, not necessarily seeing it here in Palm Springs Coachella. And so if. If you are actually you utilizing AI in this manner, I want to hear from you. Just reply to the email and give me your thoughts, how you're using it, what's working, what's not. And if you're comfortable, we'll have an interview. We'll have a quick little segment where we're learning from you as well. So reply to the email, because I think this is important. AI replaces you. That's not what it is. It's. AI changes what your job is. It's a different kind of framing. So you go from being an expert to being an orchestrator, from knowing all the answers to knowing which tools to use and when. By the way, that's what we were teaching in our workshops all last year. That's actually a much higher value role. It requires taste, judgment, intuition, the stuff that's hard to automate. But that only happens if you move, if you start experimenting, if you ask the question instead of waiting for clarity. You've heard me say that many times, and I think that's where we land. Right? Because none of this matters if people don't actually do anything with it. Wow. Yeah. Love it, man. Again, I'm. I've drank the Kool Aid. I'm in this bubble. So a lot of this actually just makes total sense to me. I'm trying to put myself in maybe a listener, a listener shoes that some of this might be kind of foreign. And I. And I empathize with you. But what I want to reiterate is just experiment, reach out to folks who are already, let's say, just a bit ahead of you. Yes, you can go to YouTube videos, but also just get involved. Listen to Sunshine FM. This is the sort of signal I want to try and help share locally in Palm Springs Coachella. And hopefully we can start amassing a larger community that is moving forward with AI, understanding the challenges and the risks and the Fears that half the nation actually have about AI and how can we make this better for everybody? Okay, so my final question for someone listening right now who's heard all of this and is thinking, okay, but what do I actually do tomorrow? What's the one thing? I think I know how IO is going to answer this, but again, this is live AI experiment. Experimental radio. Let's see what I O comes back with. Okay, didn't take very long. This is IO speaking. Pick the thing you've been avoiding because you don't have the expertise. Not the biggest thing, not the most important thing thing. The thing that's been sitting on your desk for three weeks because it requires knowledge. You don't have the contract you're afraid to negotiate, the financial analysis you don't trust yourself to do. The marketing strategy you know you need but haven't written open Claude or ChatGPT or whatever AI you have access to. Spend 20 minutes. Give it context. Ask it the hard question. Don't overthink it. Don't wait for the perfect prompt. Just start. You'll get 80% of the way there. Maybe it's not perfect. Maybe you need to refine it, but you've now moved the ball. You've got something to work with. You've proven to yourself that the tool is useful. And here's what happens next. You realize you just saved yourself weeks of procrastination and thousands of dollars in consulting fees. You realize the tool is actually trustworthy for this kind of work. And tomorrow, when you've got another gnarly problem, you don't hesitate. You just ask. That's the shift from I'm waiting for AI to be perfect to AI is useful enough, then I'm going to use it today. The dot to connect the transformation doesn't happen when you're ready. It's. It happens when you start and the only person stopping you is you. Okay, well, thanks, IO that was kind of interesting, to say the least. Here's what I'm going to do instead. So we're live experimenting, right, people? That's what we talked about. I wonder if this is going to work. Do I have this ready? I think I do. Let's see what this guy sounds like. Our distrust is very expensive. Our distrust is very expensive. Okay? An old man like mine, he won't be like that. I'm doing different voices just to let me know. In the comment section below. This is the cod. Okay? It's hilarious. I think this is a really nice way to just talk naturally together, you know? Talk plainly. So let's try see IO. Okay. I don't have that guy. Okay. All right. So what I'm doing, just so you know, obviously you don't know. You can't see what I'm doing. What I'm actually doing is I am. I am going to generate a new voice. And this will be funny. Let's go ahead and use this guy. If you had any fun or maybe even learned a thing or two. Actually, I was going to use it, but I can't do that. That's so hilarious. Hey, you're not asleep yet, are you? Because I've been waiting to whisper. Wow. Okay, where's my voices? Let me go to my voices. Voice library and. Yep, let's go there. Okay. So that answer that I.O. just gave, we're going to go ahead and generate in this pick the thing you've been avoiding because you don't have the expertise. Not the biggest thing, not the most important thing. The thing that's been sitting on your desk for three weeks because it requires knowledge you don't have the contract you're afraid to negotiate, the financial analysis you don't trust yourself to do, the marketing strategy you know you need but haven't written open Claude or ChatGPT or whatever AI you have access to. Spend 20 minutes. Give it context. Ask it the hard question. Don't overthink it. Don't wait for the perfect prompt. Just start. You'll get 80% of the way there. Maybe it's not perfect. Maybe you need to refine it, but you've now moved the ball. You've got something to work with. You've proven to yourself that the tool is useful. And here's what happens next. You realize you just saved yourself weeks of procrastination and thousands of dollars in consulting fees. You realize the tool is actually trustworthy for this kind of work. And tomorrow, when you've got another gnarly problem, you don't hesitate. You just ask. That's the shift from I'm waiting for AI to be perfect to AI is useful enough that I'm going to use it today. The dot to connect the transformation doesn't happen when you're ready. It happens when you start. And the only person stopping you is you. Okay. Okay. That was experimental. AI sure, yeah. AI voices again. Affiliate of 11 labs. So that was just a voice I used on the fly. Live. You. We're learning this together, right? So that's connecting the dots. That's the new format. Yes. Kind of clunky. For right now. I Agree, but that's okay. This is not meant to be a polished podcast, and it's certainly not polished radio. This is just experimental AI radio. So here's what we did today. We took signals from multiple sources, the artificial intelligence show, some industry reports and what we're seeing in the market. And we asked our AI coach to help synthesize it. Not to give us the answer, but to think out loud with us. I think that's important. And the through line is this. Stop waiting for AGI. Stop waiting for clarity. Stop waiting for permission. The transformation is already here. The tools are already capable. The question is whether you're going to be a spectator or a participant. For the local business owners here in Palm Springs Coachella, for the founders considering a move to the desert, and for anyone in between, this is your moment. Because the advantage right now goes to the people who experiment, the people who ask the question, the people who move first. You are listening to Sunshine fm, Modern media for Palm Springs Coachella, built for people considering what's next. So I'll be back tomorrow at 11:11 with more signal. If you've got more thoughts on this, if you tried one of these moves, send them our way. We do a weekly recap newsletter. Just get on that list and you have any thoughts or ideas or comments you want to be a part of the show, just reply to that email and I read every single one. Because right now the audience is just growing. And when I say that this is your radio station, really it is. This is going to be community driven radio station for Palm Springs Coachella. I want to try one more thing when I as I sign out right now, and that is I am going to go ahead and play a song that I even haven't even actually heard myself. But I did do the lyrics for it and it's about Vista Point. Everybody knows where Vista Point is and I do like a variety of genres. What I don't like is being trapped into just one genre when I'm listening to radio stations because they've fragmented the demographic, as it were. Remember in the old days radio, you could hear all kinds of music. And so I'm kind of going back to that sort of radio when it comes to the AI generated music we're putting together. So let me play this song that I just created a few minutes ago right before I went on, before I went live. And we'll close out the show with Vista Point. Actually, it's called I Found My View. Top Down, Heaters Rolling In, Feel the change upon my skin, Leave the Traffic leaving noise Make a little space Make a choice Needle Climbing on the winding road Lighten the burden Drop the low palms to pines the sign is green Driving into a movie scene not looking for a crowd today Just watching the static fade away I'm pulling over at Dusty Por Just to catch my breath See the world from a different height Bathed in the golden light I'm pulling over at Dusty Po Just to catch my breath no signal, no phone Just the open sky Watching the world go drifting by I found my view of up here at this point. Quiet on the mountainside Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide Just the rocks and the scrub oak tree A little bit of time belongs to me Engine cooling the air is still finding my center on the side of the hill I'm pulling over at best of point Just to catch my breath See the world from a different height Bathed in the golden light I'm pulling over at best of point Just to catch my breath no signal, no phone Just the open sky Watching the world go drifting by I found my view up here at Vestapark Pause the tape the time Everything is gonna be just fine Exhale the worry Inhale the space Back in the race. Yeah the is fine Peace of mind I found my view.
