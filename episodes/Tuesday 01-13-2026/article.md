HEADLINE: Forget AGI. The Real AI Revolution Is Already Here.
---
The future of AI isn't some distant, god-like intelligence. It's happening now. You hear the chatter: "When does AGI arrive?" "Six months! Five years!" It's a moving target, and frankly, it's a distraction. Paul Rotzer nailed it: we don't need Artificial General Intelligence—however you define it—to utterly transform business, your work, and your future. The shift isn't coming. It's already here. Code assistants ship daily. Your email is getting smarter. Billions of dollars flood hundreds of companies, not for some mythical finish line, but for immediate, tangible utility. The real question isn't "When will AI change my business?" It’s "Why aren't you using it right now?" Your immediate opportunity? Treat AI as your multidisciplinary advisor.

What does a "multidisciplinary advisor" actually look like on a Tuesday morning? Imagine you're a real estate broker with a client eyeing a commercial property on Palm Canyon Drive. You know the market, but you're not a tax attorney. You’re certainly not a structural analyst. Here’s the concrete move: upload the preliminary lease agreement and three years of property tax data to your AI—be it Claude, Gemini, or ChatGPT. Prompt it: "You are my senior commercial real estate strategist and tax advisor. Analyze this lease for hidden escalation clauses. Compare the tax history against current Riverside County trends. Summarize the top three risks for my 11 AM meeting." In minutes, you’ve provided high-level decision intelligence. The kind that typically demands a $500-an-hour consultant. This isn't theoretical. It’s happening. This is *why* capital flows so fast. Billions aren't chasing the theoretical AGI. They're flowing to usefulness at scale. They’re betting on immediate revenue from AI that helps people think and work faster, right now. Every major company integrating AI agents has seen the gap: the chasm between what one human can do, and what one human *plus* AI can do. That gap is leverage. That gap is where the money is.

If AI can do all that, then the real question isn't about AGI. It's about your job. "If AI can do my job, am I obsolete?" This is the uncomfortable truth: you aren't. Not exactly. The human becomes the filter. Most work is linear: Task A, Task B, Task C. Each demands judgment, but they’re sequential, time-bound. AI executes A, B, and C in parallel, then synthesizes them. The bottleneck shifts. It becomes: "Which of these 50 options is the right move?" That’s judgment. That’s taste. That’s the human intuition and context machines can't replicate. You aren’t the executor anymore. You are the decision-maker, the orchestrator, the taste-maker. You say: *this* matters, *this* doesn’t, *this* is the direction. But here’s the crucial part: this only happens if you embrace it. Stay rooted in the old model, trying to be the expert who knows everything, and yes, you will get run over. Be willing to ask, iterate fast, and make decisions, and you become ten times more valuable. Obsolescence isn't about capability. It's about adaptability. The people moving win. The people waiting lose.

So, what do you actually *do* tomorrow morning? Simple. Pick one thing. Not the biggest, most critical task. Pick the thing you've been avoiding because you lack the specific expertise. That contract you're afraid to negotiate. The financial analysis you don't quite trust yourself to do. The marketing strategy you know you need, but haven’t written. Open Claude, ChatGPT, or whatever AI you have access to. Spend twenty minutes. Give it context. Ask it the hard question. Do not overthink it. Do not wait for the perfect prompt. Just start. You will get 80% of the way there. It might not be perfect. You might need to refine it. But you’ve moved the ball. You have something to work with. You’ve proven to yourself the tool is useful. And here's what happens next: you realize you just saved yourself weeks of procrastination and thousands of dollars in consulting fees. You realize the tool is trustworthy for this kind of work. Tomorrow, when another gnarly problem lands on your desk, you won't hesitate. You'll just ask. That’s the shift. From waiting for AI to be perfect, to using AI because it’s useful enough, today. The transformation doesn't happen when you’re ready. It happens when you start. The only person stopping you is you.
