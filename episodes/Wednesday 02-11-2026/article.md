Hey,

This is Sat. Just poured my second glass of wine and I'm still thinking about today's show - specifically that bit about computer science enrollment dropping for the first time since the dot-com crash. That one's been stuck in my head all evening.

## The Real Estate AI Revolution Nobody's Talking About

You know what really got me thinking today? These AI startups like Underbuilt and Dono that are basically turning the entire real estate industry inside out. I mean, we're sitting here in the Coachella Valley - a place where real estate IS the economy - and most people have no clue that AI is about to make property records, title insurance, and even house hunting look completely different.

Here's the thing that hit me after the show: we've got this $50 trillion real estate market running on systems that are basically held together with digital duct tape and literal pen and paper. And now AI is saying "hold my beer" and solving problems we didn't even know we had. 

The personal side of me is kicking myself because I could have used that Underbuilt tech years ago when I was making some questionable property decisions. But the radio guy in me is thinking - how many people in Palm Springs are going to get blindsided by this?

## UC San Diego Gets It (Everyone Else... Not So Much)

Here's what's keeping me up tonight: UC San Diego was the ONLY campus in the entire UC system to launch an undergraduate AI major last year. One. Out of ten campuses. Meanwhile, computer science enrollment is dropping everywhere else because students are terrified there won't be jobs.

I've been talking to Cal State San Bernardino for two years about this stuff, and it's like watching bureaucracy in slow motion. These kids are smart - they see the writing on the wall. Tech layoffs, 25% drop in new graduate hiring, experienced developers competing for entry-level positions. No wonder they're scared.

But here's my cynical take: the schools that adapt fast are going to win big. The ones that don't? Their graduates are going to be serving drinks to AI engineers. Nothing wrong with bartending, but when you've got a comp sci degree...

## The 71% Question

That Reuters poll saying 71% of Americans fear AI will put too many people out of work? That number feels real to me. Not because I'm some doomsday prophet, but because I talk to people here every day. The bartender with AI skills, the students asking what they should study, the parents wondering if their kid's degree will matter.

What's wild is we're getting these predictions from the people actually building this stuff - like Anthropic's CEO saying half of entry-level white collar jobs could be gone in five years. These aren't random fear-mongers; these are the architects.

## The Local Reality Check

After a couple glasses of wine, here's my honest take: the Coachella Valley is either going to adapt or get left behind. We've got 20,000 students at College of the Desert alone. What's the plan when hospitality gets automated and white-collar admin work disappears?

I keep coming back to that conversation I had with our local software engineer. He's 22, brilliant, and it's taking him months to find work while competing against laid-off developers with years of experience. If that's not a signal, I don't know what is.

The universities that figure this out first - like UC San Diego with their AI major - are going to be the ones producing graduates who aren't just surviving this transition, they're leading it.

Maybe I'm overthinking this because it's been a long day and the wine is good, but I think we're living through one of those moments that's going to look obvious in hindsight. The question is whether we're paying attention.

Talk soon,
Sat
