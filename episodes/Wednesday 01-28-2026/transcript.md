Yes, you are. You are listening to Sunshine fm, Modern media for Palm Springs Coachella. You know, I was just. Actually, I was creating those station IDs on the fly as we went live. I was just putting them out there, creating them quickly. And as we've said before, what is Sunshine fm? Sunshine FM is modern media for Palm Springs Coachella. And here's what's happening. If you've been listening for the last few weeks, let's be transparent about what we are doing. You are listening to a radio show that's being built by a human. That's me. My name is Sat. I'm the. My title on this one right now is Radio Station manager and an AI working together. We're not trying to hide that we're using AI. Like, maybe, I don't know, we're kind of seeing ourselves as a consumer myself. You know, two years ago, we knew it was AI. Now we don't necessarily. Actually, there's two things going on. One, maybe we can tell, maybe we can't, because AI is getting so much better at audio, video, music, voices. But I think what also is happening, especially if you speak to the younger generation like I do constantly, there's this certain kind of acceptance that, yeah, you know what, Some AI entertainment, some AI videos, some AI influencers, it's okay by me. And so we're in this kind of messy middle of how the world was before generative AI went mainstream, and where we are kind of graduating into this new world of AI everywhere. So Sunshine FM was an idea that had a couple of years ago. It's just taken me a little while to get here, purely because I was too busy being distracted, not only with my own brand clients, but locally in Coachella Valley, trying to get all the cities and all the leadership in all the organizations to wrap their arms around this AI, because it's going to be a tsunami here in Coachella Valley. And if you've lived here long enough, you also know we're generally very late to most tech movements and tech upheavals. And coming from the tech industry, this is no different. When I'm. When I come back from the cities, especially the Bay Area, and you come to the Coachella Valley, you definitely feel like it's a couple of years behind. Now a lot of people in town will say, you say that they're not, because everybody else is behind. You know what? That's fine. You can talk from that playbook. I see things differently. The folks in my network in LA and in London, Stockholm and the Bay Area, the conversations we're having, they're slightly different than the conversations I'm having locally. So I'm not hiding the fact that I'm using AI. Sunshine FM is finally my way of saying, hey, I'm. I can't seem to get through or I can't seem to make a case for AI. Let me just go ahead and experiment with AI myself. I'm learning on the fly, on air. This is live, if you're listening. Thank you very much. We're not pretending that I wrote everything alone. Everything I'm doing is with the, with AI's assistance. Now, having said that, what I've also learned over the last two and a half years of experimenting with AI and talking to folks who are much, much smarter than I am about this technology and about this actual, this actual change in the digital landscape, I think it's less about the technical aspects about AI and it's more about the strategic use case of AI, which is just as well because that's my playbook. I'm not a tech guy. I come from the brand world and strategy. And so this actually is right in my wheelhouse. I'm an ideas person. And how do you take an idea from 0 to 1? That that's where I basically found my fame and fortune. And I think, I believe, I mean, I'm pretty well positioned to carry on doing what I'm doing in terms of strategy. But I think there's a lot of conversations being had about developers and technical use cases and I'll get into that later. If you listen to the last couple of weeks, you see, I've got a kind of a nuanced take on this. And it's not just me, it's smarter people than me who are talking about this. So basically the way I kind of create the show is at some point in the next two months or three months, maybe two months, let's push it. Okay. Next two months, Sunshine FM will be a 247 AI generated music and content and entertainment hub. Every piece of music. A couple of things. One, yes, AI generated, however, just like a producer does. I used to be in the record industry, so just like a producer does, you don't just take the first shot at this. You write, you rewrite and you record. You re record, you change arrangements, you change styles, you slow down the beat, you, maybe this is better as a ballad, etc, you have all these conversations in a recording studio. This actually is no different. And while the first, you know, percentages of music will be my own, I'm also been receiving A ton. I shouldn't say a ton. A handful of AI music from local folks who are playing around with and experimenting with AI. So I will also put that on air. And my hope is there's a lot more folks in town in the Valley who are experimenting with AI, not just music, but just AI experiments, content. And I want them to come on the show, I want them to talk about this, I want them to share what they're up to. And if it's something that fits into the music, The music segments that we have, then we will go ahead and play their music on Sunshine FM 2. And then the other part is this. You're hearing music that really you're not hearing anywhere else, right? And that's both good and not so good, I guess. You know, some music you don't want to hear again, some music you don't care if you ever hear again. And that's okay too. We're not trying to be classic rock and we're not trying to be current top 40 that you're hearing on radio stations and on your Spotify playlist all day long, right? This is an experiment in AI and so we're not hiding that fact. And the reason why I'm telling you all this is the way, you know, I've. The kind of challenges I've had, you know, we at aicv, which is my in person workshop, boot camp events venture, we did like 25 workshops last year. I've done a ton of presentations all around the Valley. I've met with many, many folks who are in leadership positions at, at the organizations and at enterprises. While definitely AI is moving at a speed that most of us can't seem to keep up with. And constantly we feel like we're behind. The future I'm trying to aim for is a future where AI and humans figure out how to work together. Some days you read the news and the newsletters I get and it feels like AI is going to basically take away so, so many jobs. And then some days you wake up and you listen to people talking about an era of abundance. It's difficult. Even though I'm a Gemini, it's difficult for me to put both of those in the same brain, as it were. But, you know, that's kind of my hope, right? How can humans and AI figure out how to work this together? And so this experiment that you're listening to at the end of January 2026 is not a hype version. This is, hopefully you will understand. It's a real version, It's a Messy, honest version. And the way I kind of work is if you're like me, you're subscribed to a hundred tech, business, financial AI newsletters. And if you're like me, you do the same with podcasts. Oh, my goodness. The thing is, I've created some agents and some automations, as it were. You know, we're calling them agents, and some of them kind of like, are because they're doing their own thing. Some of them are just purely coded automations where they will help me parse the information from these newsletters and podcasts and they will synthesize certain, like, common threads through what I'm hearing and what I'm reading and what I'm listening to. And then rather than me consume all this information and then it basically just lives in my. In my space. Sunshine FM is my outlet where I can go ahead and share that information, hopefully in a variety of voices in a variety of positions, so that you don't have to subscribe to all these newsletters or listen to all these podcasts. And even if you do, maybe you're listening to me to know that there's somebody in Coachella Valley, boots on the ground, tapped into Bay Area, some of the top AI companies, startups, and major mag7, basically. And how do we take that signal and see how it impacts us here in the Coachella Valley? That's what I do. Sometimes I read breaking news about AI right on. Right on my desktop, and I share it with you, and I'm discovering it at the same time. Sometimes the music I play, I just hit play after I've hit the prompts and some advanced options about excluding styles and putting styles. And I'm listening to it and for the first time, just as you may be. So if you're sitting here in Palm Springs or Rancho Mirage or Indio or anywhere else in this valley right now, you're basically watching a live experiment in what the future of work actually means. It's not some Silicon Valley thing. It's right here, right, right now. Anyway, that's the show. That's what I'm doing. It's just me with an army of agents. Okay? So I'm sat. Welcome to Sunshine FM Modern Media for Palm Springs Coachella. Quick reality check. If you're building something here in the Coachella Valley, or you're thinking about starting something, or you're watching what's happening with AI and work, this show is kind of a mirror for what is possible. So here's a couple of things that we're going to Be kind of changing. Right? I'm as, as I mentioned earlier, it's tough to keep up with all this stuff. I really thought my agents and my automations would help me keep up. And in a way they do. But even they kind of, you know, if you, if you played around with Chat GPT or with Claude or with Gemini, or with any of the multiple services that out there that are promising automation, you know, once the novelty wears off and you actually put this into play, it's, it's, it's sometimes, sometimes things break, things fall apart, things don't quite go the way you want. And that's happening right now in the radio station. I've been on it, I've been doing this all of 2026, and I'm not where I wanted to be. That's okay. My commitment is me and using AI tools to get this radio station off the ground. And so I'm trying something different. Today. There is a great show that's livestreamed every weekday. They're in la, actually. These guys are John and Jordy. They come from the tech world. And this show is long. It's like three hours every day. And while when I was first listening to it on podcast or watching on YouTube, it was great, it was exciting, but just like a round of golf, you just don't have time for this anymore. You just don't have time. And so what we're. What I've done this today, this morning, based on a bunch of their shows this week, is they have a great staff that goes out and gets breaking news in AI and technology and startups. They attract some of the best speakers in this ecosystem, from the VCs to the operators. And my thinking was I tend to kind of not repeat so much, but I tend to duplicate some of the stories that they reported earlier in the day or maybe sometimes the day before. And I'm getting in my newsletter or my podcast a day later. And while I try and stay up with kind of, let's just say, current, current topics, I feel as though, well, maybe what I'll just do is I'll just go ahead and listen to what they're saying, pull out the topics I think are important, pull out some of the quotes that they came out with it, which I thought was in both, you know, insightful and maybe sometimes funny. Sometimes I have the opposite take on it. And let me go ahead and give attribution to TBPN John and Jordy. And we're going to go and pull out five or six segments over the Last few days, what I thought was pretty exciting and interesting in the world of AI, a couple of them, by the way, I already spoke about yesterday. So if you listen yesterday and listening again today, apologize for the repetition, but it's okay, you hear it more than once as long as it's interesting. Hopefully it'll spark you to DM me and let's get on the show, let's talk about it. If you have a different take on this. Okay, so here's the best of the AI news this week actually to date, last three days according to the guys at tbpn, the Napster moment. I spoke about this on Monday and Tuesday. Claude Bot took the AI world and the tech world and the startup world by storm over the weekend and it has not abated. It's just gotten, it's just picking up more and more steam. Claudebot, which is spelled C L A W D Bot, it's now called Moltbot M O L T Bot. There's a, there's a lobster theme going on in there, is basically an open source AI agent that runs locally on your computer. We talked about this yesterday. The key here is locally right now, if you're on Chat GPT or if you're using Claude or Gemini, you're actually talking to the AI in the cloud. There really is no local AI that you are interacting with. So Maltbot was built pretty well, it's open source and the code is super interesting. Meaning what? It's what is give, what is what powers. It's giving you as an individual and your own local computer, laptop or desktop. But here's what's happened over the last couple of days. Even now that it's even picking up even more steam is the behavior of folks who are using claudebot on now Maltbot is fascinating. It's fascinating because people are starting to hoard Mac Minis. I kind of briefly touched on this yesterday. I even thought about it over the weekend. As a matter of fact, me and my software engineer at aicv, we talked about it last summer about getting Mac Minis at all the small businesses that were interested in implementing AI in their workflow. And we would just come in with your own Mac Mini and have your own workflows and your agents and your processes all living right in a Mac Mini on your premises. The goal was whoever wanted in town would come in, set it all up, look at your workflows, help you solve some of them, knowing that security and privacy was right there in your Mac Mini. Anyway, that was last summer. That was about eight months ago. We were having that conversation just a couple of days over the weekend. A couple of days ago I started thinking as I'm playing around with these downloaded AI coding tools that maybe I should be picking up a few more Mac Minis. Because what most people, most, most of these guys who are in girls who are all into Maltbot, they're buying, they're hoarding the Mac Minis, they're running them 247 and they're plugging them into closets like it's their own little personal data centers. Jordy, one of the hosts of TBPN, he basically compared the moment to 1999. And he, he said it feels somewhat similar to the old Internet piracy days. You can fire up Napster or later a torrent site and get an illegal copy of the Matrix. The technology was there, but it took a long time for the actual real companies to catch up. Not just from a technical perspective, but from a business perspective. Napster kind of forced itunes to launch in 2003. And same thing happened when you were on a BitTorrent site which was downloading movies. Same thing happened forcing Netflix to move from DVDs to streaming. Here's a challenge with those Claude bot Downloading Claude Code, downloading any of the AI tools that you want that you're giving access to your computer. There's security risks, there's privacy risks, and there's this black box kind of risk that you don't really have control of what you're doing, especially if you are not technical. I'm finding that firsthand. I had, I had one of these bots basically just go on creating whole bunch of new folders over and over again when we don't need it to create that many folders. The reason why is because I wasn't clear on exactly where I wanted these files to go. So I'm using a couple of them. Anti Gravity from Google Gemini and Claude Code from Anthropic. They were just basically, you know, they're there to please. So they're going to go ahead and just create organization or they're going to create what they think is organized folders. But it's mostly just chaos. So unless you're technical, just be mindful. It's okay to experiment, but don't experiment with your bank account or your health records. At least not yet. Right. You're still going to most probably have to go on a terminal on your computer to really get the most out of it. I played around with Claude Cowork lately as well and I will say while you don't have to be in a terminal, it almost feels like you have a co worker that doesn't necessarily listen to everything you say because it thinks it knows. I wouldn't say better, but it thinks it knows what I want and it goes off without. I wouldn't say permission because I already gave it permission when I downloaded it. So just be mindful, be careful. I think they're fun. I think it's worth experimenting with. Habib, my software engineer at AICV and I, we were, we are putting together a Claude Code Claude cowork boot camp that should come, that should be open to folks. Hopefully pretty soon we might add Maltbot to it because it is local and our thesis for the future is you need to be, especially if you're a business, you need to be hosting your own AI locally and your agents and your agentic workforce locally. So if you're interested in any of that stuff, DM me, get a hold of me and I'll let you know where we are and put you on the wait list. Segment 2 they talked about something we talked about two days ago, which is ChatGPT Agentic Commerce. We talked last week about ChatGPT adding ads to their free tier and their $8 a month tier. We didn't mention this, but Google Gemini also came out with a inexpensive tier, a $7.99 a month tier with, you know, reduced limits. Obviously this is competitive pressure. And we also talked about, about Google's universal commerce and we talked about ChatGPT and their agentic shopping and how you can go ahead and find products that you're looking to buy right within the chatbot. So this goes to you not as a consumer, but if you're a business owner and you are selling on Shopify or you're selling online, if our thesis is correct. And more and more people are just going to be asking chatbots or their companions for answers to their queries. They're going to be asking the chatbots and their companions about products and services. And so ChatGPT knows this and they have partnered with a ton of commerce companies and it'll be interesting to see how they do this. But the goal is if you're chatting to a chatbot and you're asking, you know, you're looking for a new Mac Mini Chat GPT will not only talk to you about it and give you the pros and cons, you can have a conversation with the chatbot and then when you're ready to buy it might have a link for you to go buy. The question then becomes is who gets that commission and is there a commission? We just learned over the weekend that that commission or that merchant fee that ChatGPT is going to charge the merchants is 4%. So many Shopify merchants, they already run on, you know, thin margins, maybe under 10%, and they may simply not be able to support this because that transaction fee stacks on top of an existent merchant and payment processing fees that retailers pay. So imagine you've got your Air Max or your Discover, your Visa stripe. You're already paying three or three and a half percent. An additional 4% from ChatGPT seems doable, but then if you shop, if you're selling on Shopify or any other merchant channel, they have their own fees as well. So is it going to be worth it? I mean, you have to figure that out for yourself on a, on a more strategic matter. I say absolutely, it's worth it because it's worth experimenting, it's worth getting in front. It's worth, if you're a small business, you can get in front of some of the larger companies. Even though Shopify is on there and Amazon has their own AI service coming out right now, I think there's an opportunity here to get in early and experiment and start figuring out how do I get ChatGPT, recommend my product and if it cost me 4%, that's okay because right now it's experimentation and it's you getting your name out. And the more I think, again, this is not any docs that we've read, but I think the more sales or the more you service the customer that came to Chat GPT for the initial question, initial inquiry, I think that Signal back to ChatGPT in the way that it was a, it was a happy customer. I think there might be a happy Customer Halo on YouTube for future inquiries as well. Now that is got. That is nothing official. That is purely Sunshine FM's version of a KPI that we're keeping track of and it's called the Happy Customer KPI. Okay. Oh yeah, I was supposed to do this too. I was supposed to do a little jingle in between stories. We started playing around with that yesterday. We'll do this next, okay. Oh, by the way, did you know that Amazon and Walmart, they also have their own on platform shopping agent. Amazon's on platform shopping agents name is Rufus and Walmart's is Sparky. And both John and Jordy thought it was pretty funny that they both landed on dog names. I do think there's something powerful about giving your agent some sort of personality. Because at the end of the day, we humans, like it or not, we want to believe that somebody is helping us and we want to give them this kind of sense of friend helping me as opposed to a robot helping me. And if you came to my TEDx talk last year, I don't think that's the way to go because I think AI companionship is taking down, taking us down a wall. Wild road. But we'll talk about that later. You're listening to Sunshine FM Modern Media for Palm Springs Coachella. Okay, that was my little interstitial to tell you we're moving on to another, another segment. Actually, you know, we spoke about Synthesia on Monday. Synthesia, if you're not familiar, is a British company that got into AI video avatars very, very early. They just raised a ton of money last week and as I mentioned on my real show on Monday, they're Now valued at $4 billion. Holy moly. And what I also said on Monday, and this is what John and Jordi are talking about because they had the founder or co founder of Synthesia on there. His name is Victor. Victor, what's your name? Don't get to it. Can't remember. And it's not about TikTok deep fakes. This is about corporate boredom, as they called it. Imagine a corporate training video, but instead of just consuming that, after you've consumed the video, you go into role play with an agent pretending to be a customer. You have to overcome objections to prove you've actually understood the content. Victor believes that's the $100 million opportunity. I come from the training world back in the day in corporate America and they've been trying to you, they've been trying to use technology to solve this forever. But I've seen the Synthesia AI avatars, I've seen the hey Gen AI avatars and two years ago they were laughable. In 2026, they are, they are actually delivering results. Meaning, yeah, I could sit through one of these and learn about a company that I just got hired by. As opposed to going to a conference room or a training room or reading a training manual. I think this is going to be pretty powerful. Obviously you don't need me to tell you that Synthesia just picked up. I think it was, it was Series Z is what they called it. And I think the key here is don't think of these AI avatar video providers such as Synthesia as trying to take on Hollywood. They said no, that's not what we're doing. We're basically taking on PowerPoint and boring training practices that corporate America does. The way he explained it on the show was wouldn't you rather have a video explain to you how insurance works over a 10 page document? And I think most of us would agree, yeah, that's pretty much what we're thinking would work better. Bottom line, boring money is where the real money is. You're listening for Sunshine FM Modern Media for Palm Springs Coachella. Oh yeah, that one kind of worked. Okay, you know, I'm going to quickly go just a bit deeper into what Victor said. The reason why is because there's a couple of things that he said that was, I think is kind of important for us locally. And what I mean by that is is this, by the way, his name is Victor Ripar Belli and as I mentioned, their corporate strategy is, Is, is basically the boring stuff. And he described the new product direction from doing AI videos for let's say influencers to corporate America and actually global corporate companies. He says it's a hundred million dollar a year opportunity and they are in front. And I think what we want to, what we want to learn here locally is you may not be able to afford Synthesia, but maybe you can afford hey Gen, we have a local heygen ambassador in town. And if you're interested in doing setting up some sort of training for your employees or whether you're a hotel group in town, whether you're a restaurant group and you want to let's say not necessarily save on the money of scheduling new employees into training, but knowing that going through AI avatar video program would get you get information to the new employees faster, quicker and deeper, I think you would take that bet. So if you're looking to put something like this together and go to Synthesia, Synthesia IO, that great company, they're mostly corporate so it's not that inexpensive. But if you want to do something slightly less expensive and still is still as impactful, hey Jen has a great product. We have a local ambassador. He's also part of our AICV community. If you want to go down that road, reach out DM me. I'll be more than happy to put you in touch because that is what Sunshine FM is all about. You are listening to Sunshine FM Modern Media for Palm Springs Coachella. Hey, cracks me up every time I listen to this stuff. They, they also had Lan Shui Shao who's the founder and managing partner of Basis Set Ventures. And she went on to say that they've just recently announced a quarter of a billion, billion dollar fund for. That's $250 million for those folks who are counting and they've been investing in AI since 2017. Very. She's extremely bullish on AI and she has, she has this kind of, I wouldn't say it's a contrarian take, because we've spoken about this at our workshops all last year too, is which kind of workers are going to be at most at risk when AI comes for your job? I think we, I wouldn't say we could all agree, but let's just say the majority of us agree that if you're in a blue collar job, it's safer than a white collar job. Blue collar job being, you know, manufacturing, using your hands. Although having said that, when you talk to the folks in robotics, and I do talk to several of them, we have a local guy who's putting, trying to put a maker's lab together here in Palm Desert. So we have local folks getting into robotics too. But if you listen to the guys who are on the frontier of robotics and humanoid, humanoid robots, robots, they're coming for blue collar work as well. I mean, it's already happening in the warehouses, it's happening in the manufacturing plants. You've got, look at the Tesla power, power, look at the Tesla car factories. Most of the heavy lifting is done by robots. I know what the numbers are, but I think I'm going to pull out a number. I'll try and get the number, get it back to you. But a lot of that heavy lifting is all robotics. And while we think of humanoids as having, let's say, like a R2D2 kind of form factor, these AI robotics, they come in all kinds of form factors. So anyway, going back to what Land said, lan said blue collar jobs are safer than white collar jobs. Basically, she says that physical jobs right now are harder to automate. I don't think she's wrong there. It's much harder to be a robotics company working physical world because models don't understand force or temperature or a lot of the nuances that we humans take for granted. We have a lot of short. We have a shortage of people in the blue collar field, such as welders. And even though they get to pay a lot of money and it's hard work, there's still a shortage, but the machines are not yet ready to automate the real work. She believes that our computers will be automated sooner than we think. We talked about this all this week about Claude Bond And Claude code how they're taking over our computers. And I do think that this weekend was an inflection point in what AI, how AI is going to be impactful on a personal level. She believes the next couple of years all this computer computer use will be automated. And the conversation that we had about Mac minis, I think that is going to be happening. And so there's going to be a lot of folks not just learning what does it mean to empower somebody on a personal level with a computer. I think a lot of entrepreneurs and risk takers, again, entrepreneurs, right, Another word. What they're doing is what folks like LAN really want. And that is she just wants a service that system level controls her digital life. Ideally, she says she just wants to take her phone and just chat with it and back at home have 10 MacBook minis that run everything so she doesn't have to do anything. I don't think she's the only one who's thinking that way. I was thinking about this just On Monday, not 10 Mac Minis, but, you know, several. Because if we are heading in this world, just think in terms of. If you're wondering why would. Why do we need data centers? I think if everybody starts moving towards having a computer that actually manages your computer and anything you do on a computer, your agent can do for you on that computer 24 7, meaning while you're sleeping, it can be doing things for you in your business, while you're busy out, it can be working at, in your desktop, in your office. If we all start thinking this way because we think, wow, there's some actual productivity gains here, it only makes sense that we're all going to want 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 10 or 20 Mac minis in our home life and our business life. And if that's the case, we're not really buying Mac Minis, we're actually buying compute use from these data centers. And I think exponentially. Exponentially. That's where the data centers are going to feel real to you and I as just regular consumers and of information and products and services in the digital world. You're listening to Sunshine FM Modern Media for Palm Springs Coachella. Wow, I'm getting pretty good at that. All right, so I did have a couple of other items. We got a few minutes and I'm doing this live, right. Because so much is happening in the world of AI and why, and I'm here to help. Trying to make sense of it from a local, from a hyper local point of view. Right. So let's quickly do this. I had a. Oh, by the way, just know that you're going to have. You're going to have some AI agents talking on the radio as well. Pretty soon. We were, we were experimenting with it right before went on air a couple of weeks ago, but it fell apart live on air. And so we've had to clean up the AI agents voices. Sometimes they. They don't know what they're talking about. Sometimes they actually do know what they're talking about. And so pretty soon we're going to have other voices on here. I knew. I know. There was an AI news last week where Palm Springs Unified School District. They. They're rolling out what the local media was calling a new AI platform called Magic School. I kind of chuckle purely because Magic School has been around for quite some time. And. While I think they were early to getting their product into school districts around the country, I did run into not just the Magic School folks at an event last year at Cal State University, San Bernardino. I also spoke to a bunch of teachers and principals who had used it, and I'm believing they're much better. But there are still challenges because really, at the end of the day, you can have the best technology. It really comes down to what's your strategy for training your staff and faculty and what is the outcome that you're looking for for your students. So I wish them the best with Magic School. I know one of my local AI folk, she. She's not the biggest fan, but we can reach out to her, see if she wants. If she. See if she wants to get on the show. She's in Orange County. See if she wants to get on the show. And we'll talk about Magic School. But not just Magic School, her framework for education, because she's a consultant for a lot of these school districts. And there was one more thing I brought up here. Yeah. Apologies for the dead air. Most of my DJ friends would be like, laughing their heads off. As I've said from day one, this is not a polished podcast. This is not professional radio. Individual home studio, army of agents. Army of agents don't always listen to what I'm telling them to do. But that's okay. Again, if you have, if you have. If you're playing around with AI and you're experimenting, you having success or you're not having success and you just want to get on air and talk about it? This is an open space. It's a safe space. I want to have that conversation because I want to learn from others locally how we're, how they're using AI or how they feel like AI is not going to be as impactful. There are a lot of folks who are still having the same conversation with me that they had two years ago. It saddens me that they haven't moved on in terms of implementing this in their cities or their enterprises, especially when they have the power to do so. And as I mentioned earlier, we do have workshops. Actually, we're kind of moving away from workshops. We're moving into boot camps. I'm getting a lot more inbound interest from businesses and enterprises who want, number one, to have the discussion and consultation about how it might work in their field. And I think what we're seeing more interest in is not sending ones and twos to workshops. We're basically doing what we call culture and change management boot camps at their, at their business place. And the reason why is I told them late last summer that the technology is good enough right now, even if we stopped all research and all acceleration of AI right now. The foundational models currently, as is ChatGPT 5.2, Claude 4.5, Gemini 3.0 and others, that technology in and of itself has the potential to unlock trillions of dollars of economic impact and GDP growth. So it's not the technology that. What I'm finding is the bottleneck in companies, it's the culture. What I mean by that is you've got various departments, you've got various people in leadership positions, management management positions, maybe different, the heads of different departments. A lot of people think it's the technology department or the cybersecurity department or the IT department that should be running AI. And while they should absolutely be part of the conversation because they are going to keep your business safe and secure, if they're that talented, you need to bring in all the other departments as well at the same time. Hr, marketing, sales, operations, they all belong in the same room. And what we do in our, what it was called last year was chat GPT Mastery boot camp is we have a safe space where people can talk about their successes, their fears, their hesitations, and nobody's judging them because me and my team, we lead that, we facilitate that conversation. It's more about everybody putting themselves out there to say where they are, where they're in front, where they're behind. And when we have that kind of sense of understanding with each other, the CEO, she has to get up and say, this is how we're leading. And, and they have to commit to this is our commitment to AI within This company, here's the resources, here's what we're going to do about it. And we know it's an experiment and there's going to be a bunch of failure along the way and that's okay. But in six months or 12 months or 18 months, we're going to come back and we're going to see where we are. If you have those two things in the morning, the afternoon conversations go so, so much better because culturally everybody's on the same page. They may not be at the same level, but they understand that there's learning for everybody and they're all rowing, they're all heading in the same direction. Once we get that done in the morning, the offerings go so well and then we get a bit more technical and we get a bit more operational about how we can actually help with the workflows. And everybody's basically so much more collaborative. And I think that's where the magic is when it comes to mid sized enterprises and, and actually even smaller businesses could do with this as well. I met with a small restaurant group, has like about seven restaurants. It was early, you know, I don't necessarily think with they know whether what they want to do. I can see with some of the places where they should be going, but it was too early for me to actually lead until they say, hey, Sat, Sunshine fm, ascv, please lead. We don't necessarily take them there ourselves. So today's Wednesday, January 28th. You've been listening to Sunshine FM Modern Media for Palm Springs, Coachella. I want you on this train. I want you on this train because I think it is going to change your life one way or the other. And if you're proactive about it, I think you'll get ahead of this train. If you're reactive, which unfortunately I'm seeing a lot more people being reactive. I'm not saying you're going to be late to it. I'm just going to say you're playing catch up. So I hope you have a fantastic day. We will talk again tomorrow and I'll send this out with one of the other artists that we have on our label. And where is she? She is here. Right. I think you'll. I think you're gonna love this one. The artist is Emmy and she has this great little, little folk tree, folk country, little ditty about Highway 74. We'll talk tomorrow.
