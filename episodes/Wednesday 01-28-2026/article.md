Hey,

This is Sat. Just wrapped the show and I'm sitting here with a glass of wine, thinking about how fucking weird this whole thing is getting.

## The Napster Moment is Real

You know what really got me tonight? This whole ClaudeBot thing - now they're calling it MoltBot with some lobster reference I don't get - but the behavior around it is wild. People are literally hoarding Mac Minis like it's the apocalypse. Running them 24/7 in closets like personal data centers.

And here's the kicker - me and my software guy were talking about this exact setup eight months ago. We were going to roll into small businesses with Mac Minis, set up local AI workflows, promise them privacy and security right on their premises. We were probably six months early, which in tech time means we were basically prophets who couldn't monetize prophecy.

The comparison to 1999 Napster hits different when you're actually living through it. That same "holy shit, we can do this now?" energy, except instead of downloading The Matrix illegally, we're downloading the entire concept of AI assistance and running it in our spare bedroom.

## Building in Public is Messier Than Anyone Admits

Look, I'll be honest - this whole transparent AI radio experiment is harder than I thought it'd be. My agents break. My automations fall apart. Sometimes I'm discovering the music I'm playing at the same time you are, which is either authentic as hell or completely unprofessional, depending on how charitable you're feeling.

But that's exactly why this matters. Everyone talks about AI like it's this smooth, polished experience. It's not. It's messy and weird and sometimes brilliant and sometimes it just doesn't work. And if you're in the Valley watching this unfold, you're seeing what the future of work actually looks like - not some Silicon Valley fever dream, but the real, stumbling, wine-fueled version.

## The Speed Problem Nobody Talks About

Here's what's making me crazy: I built all these agents and automations thinking they'd help me keep up with the AI news cycle. They do help, but even they can't keep pace. I'm subscribed to like a hundred newsletters, countless podcasts, and even with AI parsing everything for common threads, it's still drinking from a fire hose.

So I'm stealing. Well, not stealing - I'm giving attribution. There's this show, John and Jordy at TBPN, three hours daily of AI and tech news. Nobody has time for three hours, but they have killer guests and break stories first. So now I'm taking their best segments, adding my take, and serving it up for people who want the signal without the noise.

It feels like cheating, but it also feels like exactly what media should be doing in 2025 - curating and contextualizing instead of pretending to be the source of all knowledge.

## The Valley is Still Behind (And I'm Done Being Polite About It)

I've done 25 workshops, met with every organization that would have me, tried to make the case for AI adoption. The conversations I have here versus the ones I have with my network in LA, London, Stockholm - they're different universes.

People here keep saying everyone else is behind too, so we're actually fine. That's not strategy, that's cope. And I'm tired of being diplomatic about it.

So instead of continuing to bang my head against conference room walls, I'm just building. Sunshine FM is my way of saying "fine, I'll show you instead of tell you." By March, this will be 24/7 AI-generated everything - music, content, voices. A real-time demonstration of what's possible when you stop talking and start doing.

## What Actually Excites Me

The music part is getting interesting. I'm not just hitting generate and playing whatever comes out - I'm producing this stuff. Rewriting, rearranging, changing styles, slowing beats down. It's exactly like being in a recording studio, except the musician is an algorithm.

And people are starting to send me their AI experiments. Local folks playing around, creating weird stuff. That's the future I want - not AI replacing humans, but humans and AI figuring out how to make cool shit together.

Some of the music is terrible. Some of it you'll never want to hear again. That's fine. We're not trying to be your comfort food radio station. We're trying to be something you can't get anywhere else.

The whole thing feels like standing at the edge of something big and not quite knowing if you're going to fly or crash. But at least we're moving.

Talk soon,
Sat
