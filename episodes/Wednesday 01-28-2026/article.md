Hey,

This is Sat. And honestly? Three glasses of wine in, I'm still trying to wrap my head around what just happened on today's show.

## The Napster Moment Is Actually Here

You know what really got me thinking after we went off air? This whole Claudebot thing - sorry, Maltbot now - it's not just some tech curiosity anymore. I'm watching people in my network literally hoarding Mac Minis like they're prepping for the apocalypse. And maybe they are?

The comparison to 1999 Napster hit different when I said it on air than it does sitting here now. Back then, we all knew the music industry was fucked, but it took them years to figure out iTunes. This feels similar, except it's not just music getting disrupted - it's everything. The fact that you can now run serious AI locally, without sending your data to some corporate cloud? That changes the game completely.

I keep thinking about all those meetings I had with city leaders and business owners over the past two years. The ones where I felt like I was speaking a different language about AI. Now I'm wondering if I should have just started buying Mac Minis back then instead of doing presentations.

## The Honest Truth About This Experiment

Here's what I didn't fully admit on air - this whole Sunshine FM thing is messier than I make it sound. My agents break constantly. My automations fail. Sometimes I'm literally discovering the music I'm playing at the same time you are because the AI prompt didn't work the way I expected.

But that's actually the point, isn't it? This is what the future of work looks like when you strip away all the Silicon Valley bullshit and conference keynote fantasies. It's just one person with a bunch of semi-reliable AI tools, trying to build something real.

The funny thing is, I get more done in a day now than I used to with a whole team. When it works. When it doesn't work, I'm troubleshooting Python scripts at 2am wondering why I didn't just stick to strategy consulting.

## We're Still Behind, And That's Actually Fine

Look, I love this valley, but let's be real - we are absolutely behind on this stuff. When I come back from the Bay Area, it's like traveling through time. But you know what I realized today? Maybe that's not entirely bad.

All those hyped-up AI startups burning through millions in funding? Half of them will be dead in two years. Meanwhile, we're over here actually figuring out what works in the real world, with real constraints, serving real people who aren't venture capitalists.

The local musicians sending me their AI experiments aren't trying to get acquired by Google. They're just playing around, seeing what happens. There's something honest about that approach that I'm starting to appreciate more.

## The Part That Actually Keeps Me Up

What I'm really wrestling with - and this didn't make it into the show - is this tension between the "AI will create abundance" crowd and the "AI will destroy jobs" people. Both things feel true at the same time, and that's deeply uncomfortable.

I see what I can do now with these tools, and it's genuinely incredible. But I also know that what I'm doing used to require multiple people. So what happens to those people? And what happens when everyone has access to what I'm using?

I don't have answers. But I think admitting we don't have answers is more honest than pretending we do.

Talk soon,
Sat
