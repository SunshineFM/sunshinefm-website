Sam. Oh, come on. That was AI. No way. Well, I'm here to tell you, yes, that was AI generated music. Now, now, having said that, I think my son would run in here and just basically say, I can tell AI. I can tell AI music. No matter. Anyway, I ran across that over the weekend and that 80s new wave dance of, Come on, what else? I mean, can you really tell the difference between that and what's what you're listening to on local radio? Ow. Okay, fair enough. Maybe some of you can. So, good afternoon, good afternoon, good afternoon. This is SAT. You're listening to Sunshine FM. Modern Media for Palm Springs, Coachella. This is AI radio. AI radio. AI business radio for our region. Again, just brilliant. AI generated 80s song. Okay, we got a lot happening in the AI world in the last 36, 48 hours. And honestly, the stories from this weekend, the less about the individual announcements and more about what they're telling us about where we already are in 2026 and where we might be headed in 2026. And while you know me, I'm pretty optimistic about this new technology, you also know I do point out the, the safety and guardrails and the risks and the challenges that we all have to, number one, empower ourselves with and not leave it to the big giant tech companies or even government, really, at the end of the day. So there's a few stories in here. Here's what I'm going to cover. Synthesia, which is a British AI company, it just raised $200 million at a $4 billion valuation. And it's. While Synthesia is a, like a AI video company, this actually goes deeper into where the money is. Think enterprise. Okay, two, Amazon's putting AI health agents into one medical. That's their healthcare service. And the way they're doing it, with a lot of caution, a lot of guardrails could be a template for how AI and healthcare could work. We'll, you know, go into that a bit deeper. There's a company called Phoebe that's using agents to fix the home care market. Now this. I kind of surfaced this on the, on my radar purely because I think the home care market, especially here for the Coachella Valley, it's huge and it's only going to get bigger. And so I think there's some good, like, takeaways from this little story. We're going to talk about One of the VCs I happen to have a chat with not too long ago, and he came up with another cool little article about what we need to be looking out for in terms of the economic and social impact that AI can have in the US but let's just say broadly for the rest of the year. And then what I normally do is I try and tie it all together and ask the bigger question about what does all of this mean for Palm Springs, Coachella, and all the cities in between. Because all of this stuff, the agents, the healthcare, the coordination problems that startups and big businesses or big tech companies are trying to solve, well, at the end of the day, it applies to us on a daily, daily basis. So let's get to it. Synthesia. If you've seen the AI Avatar products over the last two, three years, you pretty much knew they were AI, right? That's a given. They look very kind of janky. And you could just tell a couple of years ago, the eyes were kind of not facing the camera. A year ago, the voice wasn't syncing with the lips. Well, we're in 2026 now, and a lot of these companies have had many millions of hours of training and millions of hours of feedback and how they can get better. And obviously the technology is just getting better. And I'm here to say that some of the stuff you cannot tell. Now, having said that, if you're trying to put a newscaster on broadcast TV with an AI generated avatar, it's not necessarily going to work. But here's where the AI agents actually get boring. The company Synthesia, as I mentioned earlier, has raised $200 million at a $4 billion valuation. I mean, I know in AI that seems, you know, par for the course, but let me tell you, $4 billion valuation for a company that's just a few years old is. It's, it's unthinkable, really. And Google Ventures was leading this. And, and that's not necessarily a vote of confidence in AI video. It's a vote of confidence in enterprise AI agents. And so let me be clear. What they're not trying to do is go viral. They're not trying to make AI slut for Twitter. They're building conversational agents that teach people inside companies an AI version of your CEO that can answer questions, respond to employees, roleplay scenarios, explain things in a personalized way. Yeah, I know, sounds truly boring, but that's also training video software. Right, but think about what's actually happening here. We're. They're talking. Cynthia. Synthesia is taking agents, which let's, you know, let's be real, people are kind of obsessed about, and they're taking visual AI, which is getting better and better, like I mentioned. And they're pointing both of these technologies at one of the biggest unsexy problems in America. How do you upskill workers fast when everything keeps changing so quickly? When the cost of content creation goes down to zero, engagement goes up, workers actually understand the material instead of zoning out in a conference room. And the reason this matters, because this is where real money is being made right now. The money is not being made in chat, but chat. We talked about some of the stuff that came out of Davos last week and how some of the large foundational models are just, you know, out there pitching for more and more money, right? More compute, more money. This is not image generation for fun. This is actually using AI to solve actual problems. Problems for people that have the money and in this case, enterprises. So while sora, which is OpenAI's video gen tool, and VO3, which is Google's, they all get the hype on social media. Synthesia is actually getting this funding and that kind of tells you where the actual value is. So let's move on. Oh, by the way, actually, before we move on, I put a note to myself about this. Hey, Gen is another AI video avatar company and they've picked up a ton of money over the last 12 months. They have this program called hey Gen Ambassadors. And if you listen to my show last week, you'll know that one of our local marketing agencies, Swing Point Media, is an actual official heygen ambassador. So if you're looking to get into AI video avatars for training purposes, I mean, can you imagine the onboarding of all this information in, you know, hotels and in, in larger retail stores? Imagine in, in sort of like sitting through a conference room with, you know, a lot of folks in the chairs listening to somebody at the, at the, on the PowerPoint, you could actually have one on one training with an AI avatar and you can ask questions to it and it responds back when you're not getting something. And it's almost like a private tutor. Hey, Gen also offers this. So get in DM me. Let me know if you're interested in this. I'll be happy to introduce you to somebody who's part of our AICV community. Okay, so segment two, Amazon's Healthcare Play. Okay, Amazon is not like a Facebook where they move fast and break things. They tend to do a ton of sandboxing and experimentation before they come out with something. And this is no difference. They just dropped a health AI agent into one medical personalized to your medical records can explain lab Results, answer health questions, book appointments, manage meds. Yes, that's what we all thought technology was going to do for us. It hasn't. AI is here to. I don't know, is it going to make it better? I mean, if you've gone into healthcare lately, they're still using pens and copies of copies of sheets that you're going to fill out on a clipboard. It's broken. Here's where their announcement is kind of interesting, right? They spent a ton of ink on their PR talking about HIPAA compliance, clinical safety guardrails and how they've worked with doctors at every stage. They're being really careful, intentionally careful. Why? Because healthcare and personal health is the one place where people still care about accuracy. And this isn't entertainment, this isn't finding out which AirPod you should buy. This is am I dying? This is should I take this medication? People will forgive AI for a lot. Yeah, I don't know about that. What they won't forgive is AI for killing them. What a great line. So Amazon, doing what good AI companies do here, they're embedding the agents into existing infrastructure with human in the loop. If the agent thinks you need a real doctor, it tells you that it doesn't try to solve the whole problem. It's basically triage. And this is following OpenAI's chat, GPT Health and Anthropic's Claude for healthcare, which both dropped earlier, I'd say last month. Everyone's racing into health, but the ones that are doing it right are the ones being cautious. Right? So this is a pattern. I want you to notice boring guardrails and caution are features, not bugs. And we, we are going to deep dive into these announcements by OpenAI, OpenAI and Claude and now Amazon about how AI is moving into healthcare segment three, Phoebe and the self driving workforce. Okay, so agents aren't replacing people just yet, they're coordinating them. This was a good story in terms of those folks that I run into who are concerned, rightfully so, about how AI agents maybe replacing the workplace. So there's a startup that is trying to take on home care here in the Coachella Valley. We know a lot about it. There's a lot of sandwich generation here locally. You're looking after aging parents while at the same time looking after kids. Home care has kind of just blown up over the last decade and I mean, I'll be upfront, you know, we had challenges with this in London and currently have challenges with this here in California. Home care is a mess. There's 4 million workers, $160 billion in spend, and it's all still run like a cottage industry. People are still coordinating shifts on paper, families not knowing what's happening, caregivers not knowing which gig to take, and agencies drowning in admin. Phoebe has just raised $10 million to solve this with agents. Now, don't think about robots in scrubs. That's. Maybe Japan is doing some of that right now. This is basically back of house stuff. Agents that remember which shifts need filling, matching workers to those shifts, messaging families and tracking everything, and they do the work that coordinators used to do, except they never sleep and they never forget. And here's the beautiful part. Phoebe isn't trying to replace home care workers, it's trying to coordinate them better. Hopefully if everything goes off. And by the way, their results to date actually do show. This is workers make more money, families get better care, agencies get better margins, everyone wins. We kind of hope so. The company's model is clever. They embed themselves in existing infrastructure. This is important because when you first read that first part about all the stuff the agent is doing, there's a ton of startups that have been doing this for the last decade or more. The thing is, most agencies and most workers and most families have to download an app based around the ecosystem of that, let's say software as a service that people have signed up. Signed up to. Right. What chatbots can do is they can actually live no matter which ecosystem you signed up to. And I think that's the powerful difference between what I want you to think about how AI agents are doing things differently than all the previous software. As a service tech companies, these are just agents that run inside the system doing the work that nobody wanted to do anyway. Well, that's. Yeah, I get that it's admin stuff. And this, I guess, is the reason why this popped up. Not just because home care locally, but also because what. What real agentic AI could look like in 2026. Right. It's not going to be flashy, it's not going to make headlines in the Palm Springs Post or Desert sun, but it's fixing markets that were literally broken because they lack the coordination layer. And this AI agents can now provide. I think the promise here is that, you know, this is they're not here to eliminate jobs, they're here to fix broken markets. And if we can take that kind of thinking and mindset and apply it to a whole bunch of industries throughout the valley, I think that's where some of the victory is going to Be at least in the short term. It's also the conversations I seem to have in our workshops that we did last year and the conversations that I have right now with local businesses and founders. Here's something. The next story is pretty powerful too. You know, I talk about AI companionship a lot on this show and I'm actually going to, I've already done a few presentations at some clubs in town about AI companionships, the promise and the peril. Hopefully I'll do one at the big expo that Palm Springs is putting on at the convention center in April. Yeah, maybe they'll invite me, maybe they won't. Who knows? But AI companionship is something really, really. It runs beyond technology and goes into social behavior. Right. Whether you're a kid or you're an aging senior. Right. Or aging individual. So Meta, makers of Facebook, Instagram, actually owners of Instagram. Right. They're putting a pause on teen AI characters. But why? Well, they just paused teen access to the AI characters on its platforms ahead of a new version. Quick story, but here's how it matters. They're being careful because teenagers get emotionally attached to AI companions and it's real. And while social media, they've been, you know, they, they talk a lot and the actions speak differently, I think the, they realize that this AI companionship kind of bonding is more real and more powerful than the parasocial relationships that we have with Instagram followers or TikTok followers. And so Meta's had these characters. They, you know, they've put them out there on, on Instagram, they put them out there on WhatsApp and teens were using them. And now Met is realizing they're pumping the brakes. Might also be because, you know, there's a whole bunch of social media pushbacks in Australia, in Britain, in France, in Canada for protecting, let's say, folks under 16. When I read this story, I was didn't mean to read between the lines, but that's why you listen, hopefully to me is because I do read between, between the lines. They're doing this because they realize what a challenge this is. Sure, we'll give it to the adults, but for teens, it's not going to be good pr. And how do we control it while still making money? Obviously, let's not, let's not forget who they are. Right. If real human relationships are hard and expensive, AI companions are free and never say no. And folks, people without much agency, like teenagers, generally going to choose AI. I see this firsthand when I go to the schools and talk to the kids. They're open about it. They've got friends. You know, I think I did it. I talked about a study a couple of weeks ago where I think it was just over 50% of teenagers in high school have a companion that they talk to regularly. While Meta is pausing on this seems to be responsible. I think at the end of the day, it's acknowledgment that they're building something that they have no idea how to control. I think that's the bigger picture. Okay, so as I mentioned at the top of the show, One of the VCs I spoke to just not too long ago about digital exhaustion and fatigue, he came out with an article over the weekend about the narrative about how society kind of is breaking apart. And here's his kind of take. Okay. The narratives we tell ourselves matter more than what's actually true. We're obviously seeing this firsthand. If you talk to your, I guess, people in your family too, right? Neighbors, colleagues. What seems to be more true in people's mind is the stories that we tell ourselves as opposed to what they see with their eyes. And it's obviously dangerous. And so what the VC says is the big narrative that came out of Davos last week and we've been hearing from the tech companies for the last couple of years when it comes to AI, is that AI is going to solve America's debt problem and it's going to accelerate GDP growth. Washington, New York City, San Francisco, they're all betting on this story. And the reason why they're all betting on the story and hanging their hats on this is because if AI doesn't deliver this growth, everything will start falling apart. And if it doesn't deliver, then the markets and companies and people, they're going to be searching for what he calls GDP sweeteners, which by the way, in his view, includes war, natural resource extraction, not great alternatives. And then there's the wealth story. We spoke about this a couple of weeks ago. But AI is concentrating wealth even further, period. The only question is whether people feel like they can still make it in America or whether they feel like the ladder got pulled up. And if they feel that way, you get confiscatory taxes, wealth taxes, political instability. And underneath all of that is the human story. People are defaulting into depression because the real world doesn't have room for them anymore. So they're finding meaning in weird subcultures. And as these subcultures get weirder and more isolated, we as humans stop being able to relate to each other at all. So what he says is we're all just living in little cults. We're not trusting institutions. We're not trusting truth. We're living in a digital world where AI girlfriends seem better than real relationships because they never say no. And his conclusion, basically, is even if we get the GDP growth and pay off the debt, if we don't do it in a way that doesn't include people or change how we relate to each other, we're still in trouble. That's his take on the 2026 story. Not that AI agents are getting better. It's. We're building the infrastructure of a fractured society and we just don't know how to. Yeah, if you're having your afternoon cup of tea. Sorry you got so down there. But when I read that this weekend, it kind of stayed with me all through. All through the day. So I just want to kind of bring it up that there is this fine line. And while absolutely I'm here to help individuals and businesses and enterprises make the most of AI for the right reasons, at the end of the day, we have to be thinking about humans. Not just in the loop, but humans. How do we benefit? How do we empower everybody? So as I put these stories together, and by the way, I have a few more stories too, that if I have time, I'll quickly go over them too. They just popped up on my radar this morning. What does this all mean for Palm Springs Coachella? Here's what I'm kind of. Here's what I want you to try and take away or actually hear underneath all of this. Synthesia raising 4 billion. Amazon putting agents into health care. Phoebe fixing home care. Meta being careful about teen AI and lessons. Warning that if we get the economics right but lose people in the process, we failed the pattern that's connecting all of it. And it's the pattern that matters for all of us. Here is the money, the real money, the venture money, is flowing to companies. Solving boring problems with. With agents, not flashy problems. Not what if we made an AI that writes poetry? But what if we made an agent that coordinates 4 million home care workers and fixes a broken market? The pattern is where is the value? And if you can find where that value is, that's where the impact is. And that, I believe, is actually what's available to all of us. And here's the truth. We've got broken coordination problems everywhere. I just mentioned health care workforce training. You know, I used to be a trainer for large Fortune 500 companies, and it was the first line. First line. Item that used to go anytime things got tough. I haven't been in the training world in terms of enterprise in the last, you know, five, 10 years. But from what I can tell and what managers tell me, training again is not a priority for most companies. So again, broken coordination. Broken coordination throughout all of our sectors right now. Hospitality, tourism, real estate, agriculture. They all tell you things are moving pretty well, but they're only moving really well until your competitors are moving faster than you. So again, broken coordination, all of these, in my view, over the last two and a half years, I've been doing this AI stuff in, in our region. It feels like they're all waiting for someone to come in with agents and to fix them. As I mentioned last week on my show. No, there's no, there's no, There's nobody coming to save you this way. I think the goal here is don't wait for the knight in shining armors. Empower your people already with experimentation of these AI tools and think in terms of what workflow processes, what coordinations need to be better and make those systems work. Don't use AI to try and look better than others. Or look, you know, I don't know. I'm with it. Or futuristic. Ask yourself the question, what's the coordination problem I'm drowning in? And could an AI agent solve it? Again, DM me. Reach out to me. We've got a great community of AI developers and creatives in, in the Valley. Happy to connect you with those folks. And the other part is this. The VC's warning is real, right? I'm going to go a bit more into another warning that one of the foundational CEOs came out with this weekend as well. But it's real, right? We can build all these amazing tools and still fail our community if we do it in a way that concentrates wealth, isolates people and makes everyone feel like they're not part of the story anymore. So the other question I think you need to ask is, if I'm using AI to solve this problem, am I doing it in a way that helps my team, my workers, my. My community? Or am I doing it just to maximize profit and call it innovation? Because those are two different choices. And last year in a couple of our workshops, we had this conversations with the folks in the room. And while a lot of folks were nodding their heads and want to do the former, which is I want to use AI to help solve the problem and it helps my team and my workers and my community, at the end of the day, what we tend to see out there. And by the way, this very, very early days still is folks who can curtail expenses and in this case, let's just say pay payroll with AI, they're going to go down that road. And folks that can go ahead and. Get more sales with less staff, let's just say they're going to do that. There's just, I mean, I just don't see them not doing it. Except if you have a value system and a principled priority that I'm using AI to uplift my team, my community and everybody that I can, I can connect with. As I mentioned, these are different choices. And I think what Lesson was saying was this year people are paying attention to that difference. Yeah, Maybe, maybe it's 20, 26 of the year. I don't know if it's going to take longer. I said, so if you're experimenting with AI and you're one of these people who know the power of AI, consider how you can elevate your team, your community and your customers. And if you're not playing around with AI, take a look around and see which companies locally are using AI responsibly and those who are just using AI because, well, it's capitalistic tool. And if we have the opportunity to be the former, we should probably take it. Because as Sam Lesson basically says, this could be pretty bad for society if everybody's just running to the finish line with the most profits, the most concentrated wealth and the most power. Because at the end of the day, that's only 2% or maybe 10% of Americans and everybody else is going to be falling behind anyway. Those numbers I just made up. So don't take, don't take those numbers too hard, okay? The other stories that kind of popped up in my radar this morning that I thought were kind of interesting, that I wanted to quickly touch base on, were just three quick hits. 1. Chat GPT becomes a shopping assistant. I'm using this purely because I mentioned this last week how we talked about chat GPT adding ads to their free tiers. And if you're a small business in town, how do, how are you or your marketing agencies getting you prepared for agents to come out actually to, to advertise or be the folks that should be advertising on these on ChatGPT. Conversely, with ChatGPT becoming a shopping assistant as OpenAI turns ChatGPT into a shopping assistant where you can chat about products, add things to a cart and check out all from your chat window, This is where you as a small business owner have an opportunity to possibly compete with some of the larger, you know, let's say brands out there. Because if you can go ahead and upload your own product catalogs and do what we call SDKs agents into ChatGPT's ecosystem, you could get Chat GPT to recommend your stuff directly in the conversation. It's very, very early days. We ran a couple of workshops last summer saying that this was coming and that the agent SDK was was launched January of this year. And if you don't have a developer that you can talk to or if you just want to talk about this agentic shopping and how you could be recommended in conversation, reach out to me. Happy to put you in touch with some of the great devs and creatives in our network. And by the way, they're local so you're keeping the GDP local. Reach out. We're happy to help you get to where you need to get to. I think there's a kind of broader umbrella to this that we've been doing with AICV and that is how do you get mentioned and cited anyway in conversations in ChatGPT, in Google Gemini and AI mode in Gemini Perplexity and include again we ran shops workshops all last year in the fall which is about being visible, being seen. It was called get seen, get found, get heard. Right. I think there are bigger plays here. You just need to be mind not mindful. You need to start focusing in on if you believe that more people are going to be conversing with their computers to get the answers to their questions, then you really need to get in front of this and not wait till everybody else is doing it. Okay. That's what we taught last year. It's what we're going to teach again this year. So stay, get in touch. Okay. Couple of things, right? It feels like when ChatGPT announces something that is for the bigger players and is for everybody else except you as a local business person. But as we've said before, this is your local opportunity and community wide. It gives us a real seat at the table if we want to take it as AI becomes a part of everyday life. Another thing that kind of came to my radar this week was a Claude bot. Now this is different than Claude code. This is C L A W D But and what that is, it's. It's an AI assistant that lives locally. It lives and runs in your computer. It's not up in the cloud like Chat GPT. It runs on your computer and over the last week or so it just basically went viral and everybody was talking about it and using it, etc. Right. So what can you do? It can manage your emails, your calendar, it can write code, you can talk to it through WhatsApp or Slack. It's basically like having a personal assistant that lives in your laptop instead of some data center in Virginia. And here's where it gets a little interesting and a little sketchy. Security experts are raising some flags because if the thing has access to your whole system and someone figures out how to hack it or misuse it, well, that's going to be a problem. I can speak from personal experience. I've downloaded several AI agents and coding tools. And you've got to be really careful when you download download them to your computer or your desktop or your laptop, what permissions you give it and what files you give them access to. I didn't learn that the hard way. I just learned that by doing. And I realized when I was watching it do its work on my computer, I could see it was bumping up against walls that I hadn't given permission to. So there's a lot of experimentation. Just be smart, you know, don't go off the rails yourself because it will mess up your computer. But the promise of this assistant on your local computer doing magic stuff versus the security aspect, well, that's the tension, right? That's what you're going to be watching for in 2026. We're, we're currently putting together the, the, I wouldn't call it curriculum, but it's more like a boot camp of using Claude code and Claude cowork, which are both great coding for developers and coding for non developers tools that Anthropic came out with and we're currently right now putting together that kind of workshop boot camp. So if you're interested in that one, it's going to be pretty powerful. We're going to run a bunch of them all year long. Reach out DM me. I'll be happy to give you more information about that. And by the way, if you're already using this stuff and you've had some good, bad or ugly experiences with it, DM me, let's get you on the show. Let's talk about how somebody in the Valley is using this stuff and let's learn from each other. Yeah. The final thing I'm going to leave you with is Dario Amadi. If you remember, Dario Amada is the CEO of Anthropic. He was at Davos last week and he's the one who basically came out with the numbers about 10 to 20% was it, yeah, no, yeah. 10 to 20% GDP growth. 10 to 20% unemployment or did he say 50% unemployment? I can't remember. Anyway, it was on a show that I did last week. He actually just published a kind of follow up essay that got a lot of attention. He's basically saying that artificial intelligence could hit super intelligence as early as 2027. 2027 people, that's next year. And he's basically warning about what he calls civilization level risks and that if he doesn't get. If we don't get serious about AI safety and policy next now, Not later now, it might be too late. And what does that actually mean? He's talking about five big areas. He's talking about the ro. AI going rogue, bioweapon misuse, authoritarian surveillance, massive job disruption, which you. We've talked about quite a bit. And wealth inequality, which Sam Lesson just talked about in his essay this weekend on scales that we've never seen. Now does it matter for us in Palm Springs, Coachella? Well, sure, right. Because this isn't necessarily Silicon Valley or New York or Davos Switzerland stuff, right? This is reshaping everything. You know, we talked about this a couple of years ago, try to get the cities to embrace AI because it was going to affect every single resident and business of their city. It's reshaping healthcare, tourism, local business. If you're a builder or creative someone or running someone, running a company out here, we're all part of what Amadi is talking about. And while it feels like there's not much we can do to help shape it responsibly and perhaps we can't do too much. Right. The tech giants own this narrative and they own the platforms that we've basically built our whole lives on. And we can't necessarily wait for government to help out because right now the government is going to is driving without a brake, right? It's just all acceleration. Don't think it's all gloom and doom. I think there are some positive signs here. It's just that don't not tune into what folks like Dario Amade is saying. Now let's not mince words. He is talking his own book. Anthropic and Claude are one of the biggest foundational models out there that are all about safety and guardrails. And we are going to do a deep dive on their constitution that they just came out with last week, their moral philosopher team came out with. And so that's a deep dive that we want to get into. But he's not necessarily totally wrong. In the direction we're going if we don't put some guardrails, put some brakes. Not even brakes. Okay. How about a clutch? A clutch would be good, right in your car. I know that everybody's got an automatic, but a clutch would be nice because you can only go so fast in second or third gear. And maybe that's what we need, especially for a technology that really nobody, even the big foundational companies know how to control. Anyway, super intelligence coming next year 2027. That's nuts. I don't want you to think of this as abstract. I want you to think of as real. But I also don't want you to get it down about it. I just want you to DM me and let's talk about it. Let's have conversations about how do we use AI responsibly and how do we help it benefit everybody that lives, works and plays here in Palm Springs Coachella. Anyway, that's your AI and business show for Monday, January 26th. You know, I like to throw in some AI generated music because that's what Sunshine FM is all about. You heard the one that I opened up the show with that was pretty amazing. There is a few is another like 80s kind of new way style that I kind of ran into with a couple of creatives who use AI generated AI tools for these kind of songs. And then I'll finish it off with our own local AI superstar Ronnie with her Palm Springs Getaway, actually PS Getaway album. So thanks for listening. We'll talk again tomorrow.
