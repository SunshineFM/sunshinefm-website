Hey,

This is Sat. Just wrapped the show and I'm three glasses into a decent Pinot with some friends, and honestly? Today's episode got me thinking about some stuff I couldn't quite say on-air.

## The Market Freakout Was Actually Fascinating

So yeah, Wall Street lost its collective mind over Claude Cowork - $285 billion just... gone. And you know what really got me? It wasn't even about what the technology can do RIGHT NOW. It was pure panic about what it might do next year. 

I've been playing with Claude Cowork all weekend, and look - it's impressive, but it's not about to replace your lawyer tomorrow. What it IS doing is making a bunch of software companies realize their $50-a-month subscription model might be built on quicksand. And frankly? Some of those bloated SaaS companies had it coming.

The Coachella Valley angle though - that's what's keeping me up at night. We've got all these small businesses paying through the nose for legal software, accounting platforms, CRM systems. If Claude can do 70% of that work for twenty bucks a month, what happens to our local business ecosystem? Do costs plummet and everyone thrives, or do we just hemorrhage more white-collar jobs?

I keep telling people in my workshops to experiment, don't just jump ship. But honestly, after seeing what happened to those stock prices, I'm wondering if the market is moving faster than I thought it would.

## Sam Altman's "Unhealthy Attachments" Comment Was Brutal

This one actually pissed me off a little. First OpenAI says they're killing GPT-4o because usage is down. Then Sam comes out this week saying it's because users have "unhealthy attachments." Right before Valentine's Day. 

Come on, man. That's just cold.

I've run enough AI companionship workshops to know this isn't black and white. Yeah, some people get too attached to their AI chatbots. But others genuinely find comfort and support in ways that aren't hurting anyone. The woman who practices English conversation with ChatGPT because she's too shy for human interaction? The retiree who uses it to work through grief? Are those "unhealthy"?

What really bugs me is the casual cruelty of it. These people built two-year relationships with this thing, and Sam's basically saying "get over it, weirdos." There's a way to handle product transitions without making your users feel pathetic for caring.

## The Music Thing Actually Worked

Okay, lighter note - that brass band track we made for the Palm Springs Air Museum? Holy shit, that turned out way better than expected. I was just messing around with some AI music tools, thinking we'd get elevator music, and instead we got this genuinely cool big band sound.

Got a bunch of DMs about it already. People want more. And you know what? This might be the first time I've seen AI create something that doesn't feel like a pale imitation of human creativity. It feels like... its own thing.

If we can nail the consistency - get the AI to stay in that style reliably - we might actually have something. An AI big band album created live on community radio in the desert. That's either brilliantly weird or just weird, but I'm here for it.

## What I'm Really Thinking About

Here's what I didn't say on-air: I think we're at this inflection point where AI stops being a tool and starts being a workforce. Not in some distant future - like, this year. And I don't think most people are ready for how fast that's going to hit.

The stock market panic was just a preview. When businesses really start replacing subscriptions with AI agents, when AI starts doing the work instead of just helping with the work, we're going to see some serious economic disruption.

My goal of getting Silicon Valley millionaires to move out here? That might be more urgent than I thought. Because if AI is going to eat a bunch of jobs, we need people creating new ones.

Talk soon,
Sat
