Sa. Wow, that was pretty cool. Doing just fine. Another wonderful AI tracks here on Sunshine fm Modern Media for Palm Springs Coachella. I got some DMS yesterday for the kind of big brass band tune that we came up with for Palm Springs Air Museum. That one. Wow. That one actually turned out way better than I thought. I love the riff, love the sound of the feel. You're not going to hear that music anywhere else but here on Sunshine fm. So send me a dm. You can get a hold of me at Sunshine FM and let me know if you like that. Let me know if you want to hear more of that. We will come out. We'll create a band around that. And if we're able to get the. What we call the. The Persona where it's always coming out that style, then we'll. We'll come out with an album. So. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. This is Wednesday, February 4th. This is Sunshine FM, Modern Media, Palm Springs Coachella. This is an experiment in how AI and humans will live together in the future. So, yes, I'm bringing the future forward, dragging it, actually dragging him back here so that we can experiment, build in public and see what some of this. Working with AI, foundational models, working with LLMs, working with AI agents or automations or agentic workflows, whatever term you want to use, and live on air, letting you know what's working and what isn't working, while at the same time bringing you the latest and greatest in the world of AI and how it's going to affect us and impact us here in the Coachella Valley. My name is Sat. I'm the radio station program manager. I'm also the founder of AICV. We ran 20 AI workshops last year in 2025 with the Cal State University San Bernardino at the ERC campus, which is the Entrepreneurial Resource Center. A ton of learnings happened all last year and this year, well, I just want to reach more people and I want to reach more people kind of live almost. Now, here's what this isn't. This is not a polished podcast. If you're like me, you're listening to hundreds of podcasts, or maybe at least a dozen, right? This is not that. So you have a lot of other podcasts you can go to to get information about AI and technology and entrepreneurship and startups and business. This is not a professional radio station. You have plenty of choices to get radio stations in the car on your mobile device of choice and listen to those radio stations. They do a good enough job with their music and they're Great on air personalities. This is not that either. So what is this? This is just a human with an army of AI agents building on the latest AI tools, succeeding some places, failing in others, but always learning. And I want you to be a part of it by not subscribing, not smashing that, like, button, but by just DMing me and say, I want to be on the show. I have some opinions about AI or I have some commentary about a story you just mentioned. Or even better, I am using AI to create this wonderful music or interstitials or station IDs for Sunshine FM. And I would love, I would love for you to play them. And I'm happy to play them. This is community radio. It's about us building together and learning together. A ton of, ton of, ton of noise, a ton of news as well in the world of AI. And I think one that's going to affect a lot of us here in the Coachella, Coachella Valley region is this news that came out over the last 24 hours about the stock market taking a tumble. You're listening to Sunshine fm. Okay. I was going to try and do like a little crash, boom, bam sound on that one. Yeah, I mean, look, here's, here's what I'm synthesizing and why I think it matters and where AI comes in on this conversation. Right. Wall street is panicking and we should be paying attention. Who is this amount? This is about Anthropic. If you're in the AI world, you know exactly who Anthropic are. If you're not. Anthropic is a research company behind the very popular Claude Chatbot. That's one of the Claude AI foundational models that we use here at Sunshine fm. They are considered the disruptor in this news flash. The victims, according to the stock market, are traditional software and service companies, specifically in the legal, finance and data sectors. That's according to CNBC tv. So what happened this week? If you've been listening to the show all this week, you'll know that Anthropic released 11 new plugins for their service called Claude Cowork, that actually, it actually released them kind of like late last week. And we played around with this over the weekend. It's an AI agent tool that goes beyond being a chatbot, where it can autonomously, autonomously perform complex professional tasks like reviewing legal contracts, managing sales pipelines and. And analyzing data without needing humans to click through software like Salesforce or Legal Zoom. So the shock investors realized this tool could make expensive software subscriptions. What we Commonly call software As a service SaaS obsolete. Obviously it's a bit of a stretch, but that's what the sell off was all about. The question being why pay for complex legal software when Claude can just do the work directly? And according to Bloomberg, this wiped $285 billion off of software stocks. Mind blown. Right? So where is this relevant for us? Well, obviously the Coachella Valley angle is we have a lot of legal and real estate and even small business admin work here. Right? So this is both a peril and a promise of AI high concentration real estate transactions and estate planning like wills and trusts for retirees. Well, Anthropic's new legal plugin automates contract review. So while this could also allow local firms to handle 10 times the volume with the same staff, it actually could threaten firms that bill hourly for routine document work. I know a ton of startups who are already working on the real estate side of things. I mentioned a fantastic AI startup in real estate yesterday. So these live shows don't get turned into a podcast. So if you missed it, just keep it. Keep a track through our newsletters Sunshine fm. And for the thousands of small businesses and the business owners in the Valley, this tool actually has a lot of promise. And the promise which has been around for a couple of years, but this year it's really gone to another level is it can automate back office drudgery like payroll compliance, etc, etc and again, if you're a small business owner and you're turning to AI like Claude code and cowork to help you with a lot of this back office admin work, you might be canceling your mid priced or expensive software that you're currently using. Now I'm not saying go and do that, I'm just saying the, the possibility is real. And that's what Wall street basically reacted to yesterday. Yeah, yesterday. When did this happen? Most of this panic hit yesterday, February 3rd. I haven't checked the markets today. I've been busy with so many other AI consulting work that we're doing and the timing is critical because it's happening right now. This is not a future prediction. That tool is live and the companies are already using it. Now how many companies are using it? We don't know. Stock market is a little bit of a, you know, it's trying to predict the future. They believe it's going to, once the dominoes start falling, it's going to be a major impact. And so why am I bringing this up to you today? As a fellow Coachella Valley business Individual and entrepreneur. Well, you've got cost cutting versus revenue risk. It's a massive opportunity to cut your costs because as I mentioned, you may not need that expensive specialized software subscription next year. And by the way, the key words there are next year. I don't think we're necessarily ready for prime time right now. But you ought to be experimenting. That's what I tell all my clients and everybody that comes to our workshops and our bootcamps. This is not like a, like a Indiana Jones tree automatically trade in a bag of sand for the gold statue. Right? This is you experimenting with Claude Cowork to see if there's some portion of your business you can actually rely on. Claude cowork or OpenAI's workflows or Google Gemini's. Offerings to see if it can actually work. So don't go canceling anything just yet, but do experiment with the stuff that we train on a daily basis. And if you happen to be in a sector in the Valley that has a chronic labor shortage, there is an opportunity for an AI employee that can handle some of the back admin work. Now, having said that, obviously a lot of you I hear from constantly in person at coffee shops and the workshops that many businesses are going to turn to the AI employee that I mentioned last week as an excuse to reduce basically jobs. Right again. And I make the rules here. I'm just saying, how do we empower everybody to get in front of this tsunami? And if you're reading the economic development slide decks and pitch presentations that thrive and shine come out with, and the cities are coming out with, if the goal is to try and attract remote workers, If the work is not there, which is the data entry, basic coding, legal review, et cetera, that is going to be. A hurdle for trying to attract those kind of white collar knowledge workers. Having said that, my goal, as you know, if you've been listening to the radio station all year long, we're going to get some of my friends from Silicon Valley who are going to be multimillionaires when their companies go public this year. And as a matter of fact, Anthropic just came out with a $350 billion employee stock sale. Yeah, we are going to get a couple of those folks out to the desert to relocate. That's my goal. So why is this story important for the radio station? Well, we're all about AI. The old AI is you. Most of you are using it this way. You're chatting with it, it gives you an answer, it gives you some text. You still have to do the work. The new way of doing AI like Claude Cowork and Open Claw and Anti Gravity and a whole bunch of other agent tick workflows that we've been sharing on the radio station. It has computer use capabilities. Basically AI can move your cursor, can click buttons, open files and act like a human employee. Anything you can do on your computer, we can give permission to AI to do it. Now there are trade offs, but just know that's the difference. Now I think when I read the story last night about what happened in the stock market and the blame was at the foot of AI. Sure, that's fine. I mean, there was a big run up in the stock market because of AI. Keep in mind, for the last year to almost two years, the reason why the stock market has been at an all time high and tearing all the time is because the Mag 7 who are spending untold billions and committing untold trillions in AI. There's a reason why the stock market was so high and I'm putting that down to mostly AI investment and the promise of AI. This is just some of it coming back. Now, unfortunately, if you're a software as a service provider, that's not the most comforting news. But just know every software as a service provider that I know of is adding AI to their capabilities. So not all is lost. Stock market, in my opinion, just kind of panicked as it does once in a while. It just panicked. Okay, so having said that, if you are a small business and you want to tap into our AICV community of developers and creatives and founders, just get a hold of me. Sunshine fm. We have a fantastic team that's growing. We can happily help you if we think there's a AI solution to what your challenges might be. You are listening to Sunshine FM Modern media for Palm Springs Coachella. All right, so talking about the way we might be using AI right now, most people I speak to and you know, feel free to ask around the office, what do you know about AI? Generally, nine times out of ten they will say, oh, you mean Chat GPT. Chat GPT just happens to be the brand name of AI. And the makers of Chat GPT are open AI. You've heard me talk about them constantly. Sam Altman is the CEO. So what is this news piece all about? Well, let me tell you who the players are, right? OpenAI the company versus the power users of ChatGPT. And the conflict centers on CEO Sam Altman, who's facing personal backlash because a whole bunch of users are feeling emotionally betrayed. By the company's recent product decisions. So what does that mean? What happened? Sam Altman announced, and we spoke about this last week, the retirement of a companion. OpenAI announced it will permanently retire the GPT4O model on February 13, 2026. We talked about it last week. The reaction this week has been a fierce revolt. Users are canceling subscriptions and protesting because they feel the newer model GPT 5.2 lacks the. And I'm putting this in quotes, the warmth of GPT4O in the conflict. Well, OpenAI claims that usage has shifted to ChatGPT 5.2. And, and here's the killer, here's the kicker or the killer, either one. Sam Altman claims that users of 4o exhibit in quotes unhealthy attachments. What? Unhealthy attachments. Now the funny thing about that is, well, it's not really funny, it's pretty serious because users are arguing that they are losing a friend, a two year bond of a companion and then they add just before Valentine's Day. I mean, Sam Altman last week had said they're retiring it because usage numbers were down. This week he's saying because it's unhealthy attachments. That, oh my goodness, that is a deep dive in and of itself. I'm making a note for myself that yes, I think I'll do a deep dive on that. I do think there is promise and peril of AI companionship. I think it has its uses and I think we just gotta be smart about it. I run a bunch of workshops locally about AI companionship. I talked about it in my TEDx talk last year. So if you have any converse concerns or want to know more about AI companionship, whether it's for kids or whether it's for the, the active adults or just in general, reach out, happy to discuss that on air so we can all learn together. So could this be relevant here? But sure, you know, obviously right now this is all happening globally, but I think it's absolutely happening here because I think a lot of folks who created, let's say AI either chatbots, customer service bots or use using ChatGPT to write their emails or write their social media posts or write their blogs, they may have moved to 5.2. But if they're, if they're seeing a difference in the tone, it's definitely because 4.0was a lot more chatty and a lot more conversational and a lot more friendly. And I put in quotes right, 5.2, when it first came out was a lot more Just scientific. And here are the facts, sir. They dial that down a bit. But I think that if your emails are post, you're having to like work a bit harder on them. It might be because you're in the new model. And the quick answer to that, beyond you know, creating Personas or creating certain prompt instructions in chat GPT was just to go. Just was just to go back to a legacy model like 4O. Well, by next week, next weekend, Valentine's Day, that will not be an option anymore. So is there a workflow disruption? There could be. So just check what model you're using and if you're happy with the tone, don't change anything. Just know this, if you're using four ohm, that's going away so your tone will change and you might want to have to re word rewrite re look at your prompt instructions for 5.2. Okay. And I think the bigger, deeper conversation here is my AI angle on this. It's the parasocial paradigm, Ducks. This is pretty much the first software technology that doesn't require a human to create a parasocial relationship. People are forming emotional bonds with their soft software. And there's a deeper dive to that because the great article on Fast Psych, an online magazine as it were, talks about the psychology of technology. And I think it's real. And while you may not be creating, forming, let's say, bonds and relationships with your AI, plenty of people around the world are, especially as I mentioned earlier, younger generation and an older generation. And while the warning from Sam Altman was that AI is a tool, not a staff member, and its personality is a software feature that can be patched out, I think you heard me a couple of times last week as I'm talking about OpenClaw, which is a different open source project, I think we are, I think we are slowly moving into a world where we do actually have AI companions, AI assistants, AI agents, AI digital workers that while right now they may be gimmicky or we can go ahead and absolutely think of them as just, you know, separate technology tools. I think we are moving into a world where AI digital workers will almost, almost be treated just like any other co worker in your business. Happy to go deeper about that. That's a. I know it's a, I know that's a kind of an inflammatory comment, but I'm not doing it for rage. I'm doing it because I think that's the world we're leading and leaning into. And let's have that conversation too. So similar to my TEDx talk. I basically said, you know, don't fall in love with software. Emotional fulfillment. We want to tell fellow humans should be filled with fellow humans. But we also know the reality is if you're forming some sort of friendship with AI companions like the movie her, that's, it's, it's on you to draw the boundaries and it's on folks like us to help you. Learn the capabilities and help you create those lines. One of the simple takeaways I Suggested in my TEDx talk was do not name your AI tools and chatbots with cute endearing names because that's how you start creating this emotional attachment. My suggestions would just call your AI tools with what they are. They're computers, their robots, their ones and zeros, their technology. You are listening to Sunshine Event. Modern media for palm springs coachella. Yeah, you know, we talk a lot about AI in Hollywood. I have a bunch of friends here in town and in la. Two years ago, a lot of anger, a ton of conversation about do not want AI anything to do with AI. Two years later, while there's been a lot more, let's say, acceptance of AI in various departments of Hollywood, it was in. It was actually surprising to me that Christopher Nolan came out and said that there's been a drop in memberships of the Directors Guild of America. Actually, was it Directors Guild or was it sag? Aftra, one of the two, apologize. This is not. I should go ahead and have one of my AI agents look this up while we're talking. Said that there was a drop in membership of about 40% and he was putting it all down to the loss of jobs in Hollywood. And a lot of that he was talking about AI driven. Now we also know that Hollywood has its own challenges and people are filming else elsewhere. But even so, 30, 40% drop in membership, that is pretty nuts. And so it led me to this other story and it's not so much about Hollywood in general. It is about this independent horror filmmaker B. Harrison Smith. He's known for Death House and Camp Dread and a star of Hollywood horror, Lauren Marie Taylor. She starred in Friday the 13th part two. We're going back a ways, aren't we? And a film that they've kind of are releasing that was generated using high lows minimax AI video model. And they debuted that film on Rad TV which is a streaming platform for traditional and web 3 content. Why this is making the news, in my opinion. Is because the horror film called Slow Burn will premiere as the first professional AI generated feature film to star A recognized SAG AFTRA actress. That's according to Scream Horror Mag. Are you a subscriber? I'm not. And unlike fully animated AI clips of the past, Smith says he wrote a traditional script and directed the AI brush, as he calls it, to build scenes around Taylor's performance. And it's trying to position itself against the AI slop that we see out there. Viral low effort content by claims of using traditional film disciplines and techniques like blocking and lighting and continuity just applied through generative tools. So while this is an LA based creative endeavor, it brings me back to what I mentioned earlier. Got a ton of friends in LA and a ton of friends out here. And I'm not sure if you've been a part of these conversations, but for the longest time I myself have been wondering why we don't have a true Hollywood studio, or at least a Hollywood what? Satellite studios out here in the desert. And for the last, you know, two or three decades, I've been told we don't have the talent out here. And when the talent comes out here, they come here to relax and rest, et cetera. We know we have a ton of directors and writers that live behind the country club gates who have a ton of below the below the line folks in the industry who also have second homes out here. And for the longest time they've just said basically we don't have the talent density to actually have a Hollywood, let's say, satellite studio out here. Since AI has come along in its current format, which is the GPT format, I think that conversation needs to be brought back to the fore. Can we actually have a Hollywood satellite studio out here? I absolutely do think so. Will the talent come here to work? Yes, because a lot of the work in LA is kind of, kind of slowly dissipating. And I'm just wondering, and I, and I say this to my VCs in San Francisco when I'm, when I'm pitching them AI startup ecosystem here in the Valley is, look, the one thing that Sunshine FM guarantees everybody that I talk to who are, who are not here currently is I can guarantee you 350 days of blue skies and sunshine. That's, that's the guarantee. We may not have the talent in dense, you know, a like, say a collection of talent, but I can see little shoots of green grass here, then everywhere that I think if we get the right people also connected and attracted to this, it could grow to be something a bit more substantial than just a talking point on somebody's PowerPoint pitch deck or somebody's city council meeting. I've been hearing that forever and very little has been done. Shout out to some of the organizations that are out there. Women in Film I think is one. There's a couple of others. I have a creative community, Desert Creatives. We're co hosting a event next week for them. So shout out to them too. They're also trying to figure out who's out here, who's the community, who wants to be involved and how do we grow this thing together and could we be a backlot for Hollywood? For sure. We have been. Anyway. There's a lot been filming coming out here, but I do think that now is most probably the best time to actually get something like a real Hollywood satellite studio out here in the desert. Going back to the film Slow Burn, it's supposed to come out February 14th, Valentine's Day. Perfect, right? Perfect Valentine's Day movie. And the reason why this timing is kind of relevant is it's arriving exactly as SAG AFTRA negotiations are set to address AI performer protections supposed to be this month. I think making this film a proof of concept that will likely complicate those talks. It most probably will. By the way, if you haven't heard of the tool. Hi Luaz Minimax. It's not for us normies. Us normies use VO3, maybe XAI's imagine, maybe Runway and a couple of other, let's say prosumer tools. This is professional grade and so I'm hoping my desert creatives next week, some of them have been using this. Let's have that conversation about what you're doing with this professional grade AI filmmaking tool. I do like the idea that it's a hybrid workflow. What I'm doing is Sunshine FM is also hybrid workflow. Use a ton of AI agents and automations and agentic workflows, but it's also human in the loop and that's me. I co create pretty much everything that you're listening to on Sunshine fm. I didn't write a story about this, but Google Gemini also is coming out with a beta release of their world engine. Actually it comes out of which Labs Emerge Labs. I think I'll come back to that. Basically creating a world around you like you do in video games on the fly. Generated on the fly. Obviously we're not a video media brand. We're all audio and so filmmaking and video and games, whole other world. I know quite a bit about it because I used to be in the video game industry, mobile gaming mostly. But because this Sunshine Fam is All audio. We won't feature too much about that, but I would love to get anybody who's in the industry who's playing around with AI tools, either for back of house or consumer facing DM me at Sunshine fm. Let's get together, let's talk about what you're doing and not especially because you're local. Let's elevate what you're doing locally as well. Okay. I think one of the takeaways I have for you is if you're a small business owner here, doesn't matter if you're in the Hollywood industry or creative industry or not. Ignore the filmmaking aspect of this. Just look at the efficiency aspect of what AI is doing for this. Right. Smith is producing a feature film in a few months and more than likely for a fraction of the cost of a traditional B movie. And I have a feeling this is the future. Actually not have a feeling. This is the future of corporate videos, local ads that use video, and even educational content. We talked about this last week where. Synthesia, which is an AI avatar company, raised $100 million. Not because they're doing avatars for kids and avatars for games. It's because they're using AI avatars for enterprise who are using it for educational content, onboarding and training. That's where the money is. Just DM me. Let me know if you're going to go see slow burn 2/14 or after or if you have any interest in seeing an AI movie. Now, obviously it's horror genre, so a lot of me and my friends aren't gonna go see it because, you know, we don't. The horror movies kind of scare us. But if you are involved in, with any AI production in movies or tv, reach out. We'd love to have you on the show. And let's talk about it, what, what you're doing and how. What are some of the pitfalls, what are some of the successes that you're finding in this? You are listening to Sunshine FM. Modern media for palm springs coachella. You are listening to Sunshine of him. Modern media for palm springs coachella. So let's quickly move over to some local stories that I found interesting that came to my kind of attention. One, I knew nothing about this, but there's this company called Techforce Robotics. And while the local news stations talked about Timmy the service robot, which is currently working at the Hilton Garden Inn in Rancho Mirage, I wanted to maybe give a little light to this and a little bit more, let's say, nuance to what Timmy might bring to Hospitality Timmy operates around the clock. And by the way, I have a picture of Timmy and it's basically like a big old weighing machine with a screen on the front and it looks like it's got a Roomba underneath the big giant scale and weighing machine. So pretty interesting. Timmy operates around the clock with fully autonomous navigation, allowing the robot to move throughout the property without direct supervision. And here are some of its duties ready for this Changing linens, making deliveries, transporting luggage, handling waste. Tasks that often require heavy lifting and repetitive effort from hotel employees. Obviously the company is saying that the robot was designed to support staff rather than replace them. The company's president has a background in hospitality, said the technology has been tested at company owned hotels for more than a year. And while some employees were initially unsure about working alongside a robot, many now see it as a helpful tool that reduces physical strain and improves efficiency. I'm going to have to make a trip down to the hotel and see it in action. According to the company, staff feedback has been overwhelmingly positive and hotel leaders say the addition highlights how technology is changing the guest experience while supporting workers behind the scenes. Okay, this is pretty cool because even just yesterday I brought up the news about Starbucks coming out with their robot army. And right away, when I mentioned that news to folks at a meeting last night, right away the, the conversation and the reaction went right to, oh great, losing jobs, replacing workers. And while I'm not here to defend what Starbucks is doing, I didn't, I did mention to them, I said, well, if you, you know, talk to the CEO of Starbucks, he says it's not replacing humans, it's here to make your time at the drive thru, spending less time in the drive thru from 90 second, 90 seconds to 30 seconds is what the goal is, right, in terms of making these drinks. So right away the humans I was talking to, they saw the benefit and they wanted that benefit. They don't want to wait longer than they need to, whether it's in the drive through or in the coffee shop itself. And so while we may talk about, oh my goodness, we don't want to lose jobs, we don't want to replace workers, we consumers are voting with our wallets and our feet by saying, oh okay, well if it works in my favor, I'm all about it. Now we're a long way from these robotic solutions, AI robotics, from replacing humans because, you know, let's go back to self checkouts, right? That's to save human checkers. And I guess the jury's still out in terms of, you know, how Many people use those. How many people don't? I tend to use them as much as possible because it does, it's generally has less of a line unless you're at Costco and then that line is just as long. So that's, that's a different story. But then you got the, the talking AI right now on drive thrus. Some, most are not very good. Some of them are brilliant. So the reason why I bring it up is because when I have a conversation with hospitality leaders for the last two years they've been saying, you know, AI is not going to come and take any jobs. Right. And even this year to come and say, well, December of last year, so last, let's say eight weeks or so, they were absolutely not thinking that AI is going to come and replace any jobs. Right. As a matter of fact, they're believing AI is going to provide a lot more jobs and opportunities. You know, fingers crossed. Let's hope that's the truth. I'm just trying to figure out the, the business model behind a company like Tech Robotics who's implementing Timmy at a local hotel. Now at some point in this use of Timmy, there has to be an roi. And the ROI right now might be you're saving on work injuries. Great, that's a great roi. You're saving on workers burnout, I love that too. Make, you know, employees time more productive without it being more disruptive or dangerous. But the ROI for a hotel, which is kind of, you know, thin margins as it is anyway, In my, in my experience it only comes in two ways. One, it's either a way of getting more business in through the door. And I'm not sure if Timmy does that. I mean it could make regular customers or regular guests visit enjoyable. And so that's, let's say loyalty and returning customers and guests, that saves the marketing costs. So it could help there. I think the real ROI is going to be. They may not be saying it, but in the executive boardrooms it's about the biggest. Generally the biggest line item in the expenses column is payroll. And if Timmy is going to save 5% or 10% in payroll, I think that's where the ROI comes in from a business model. I'm here to be proven wrong. Please, Sunshine fm, Sunshine fm, reach out to me. Let's have this conversation. I think where the trend is going is until and until the businesses and enterprises in the Coachella Valley create AI fluent jobs, which may not be for quite some time in, in a, let's say a substantial amount, I think we will be shedding a lot more workers. My hope is with AICV and what I do here at Sunshine FM is we're able to elevate more people with AI skills and fluency much quicker than if we did not exist. Yes, you are. Okay, so apparently a local artist was duped by an AI generated post last year. So he came out with a new title called Make Believe World. And he has an exhibition at Coda Gallery on El Paseo in Palm desert this Friday, 4 to 7pm and his name is Jamie Perry. Art, Coda Gallery. Okay. This weekend, Cal State University, San Bernardino. You know, I do a lot of work for them. At least I did last year. We have, like I said, a Desert Creatives event coming up next week. Got like about 28 people coming to that one. But Cal State University, San Bernardino, I don't think the local campus is doing this, but I do know that the main campus in San Bernardino has a event where it's helping students stand out in an AI driven job market. Pretty important, right? So March 12th. Actually, the pitch deck slide says March 12th. Their actual event page says March 19th. Anyway, look it up. Cal State University of San Bernardino. They're basically saying generative AI tools have made it easy for job seekers to churn out nearly identical resumes and application materials. As a result, recruiters are now also inundated with hundreds of generic resumes that look and sound the same. What they're not saying here is, you know, recruiters have been using AI tools to make sure they only get through what they want to get through. So basically they're coming out with this little event, talks about the pitfalls of using AI in your job search. And there are quite a lot because you do sound the same. What makes you stand out in a hyper competitive job market, Proven job search strategies to get you to land interviews, and productive ways for using AI in your job search. Again, all these comments and what you're learnings with without, without AI, it's almost like job search 101. The challenge is AICV was created because we felt as what was being taught in colleges and what was needed in the workspace. There was a huge chasm only getting wider every day. And AICV was there to bridge that chasm by providing students with the AI skills that they're going to need. Now, this is great that they're taking a job search focus on this, but I just want to let you know about that event. Talking about events, one more event, one I had a fair amount to do with last year City of Palm Springs Supported Chamber of Commerce of Palm Springs organized. They have their 12 3rd future PS an AI gathering for curious minds coming up on Wednesday, February 18th. We're on the 4th now, so two weeks away. What they're trying to do this coming event is the Tech Steer company that organizes the Palm Springs AI and Tech Creativity Expo. Later this year, they're going to share an early look at the vision for the expo, including its purpose, scope and opportunities for community participation. Attendees will hear how creators, technologists, educators and organizations can play a role in the as the event begins to take shape. 40 bucks a person. Just go to pschamber.org they'll get you all the information you need right there. I had a few more stories to go into, but as we're coming across coming up to the hour, let me leave you with. Let me leave you with this tune. Another AI generated tune. Let me know what you think of it. Thanks for tuning in. Feel free to catch us in our newsletter, Sunshine fm. Feel free to DM me anytime you want. Let's talk about AI all day, all night. Have a fantastic rest of your week.
