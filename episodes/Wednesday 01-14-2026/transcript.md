Sa. I heard the time to click inside the shed the day is officially dead Suddenly the water turns electric blue A chemical trick nothing is true the palm trees are black cutouts against the stars I hear the distant hum of the luxury cars the monster dancing round the halogen light Dying for a taste of the artificial brightest Strictly poolside confidential there's nobody left here Nobody but me the water is blowing like a neon sign I'm crossing over the invisible light and I'm still shadow in the water and now all blowing to lost on the electric blue. In London the darkness is heavy and wet Here it's a dry, empty sort of I watch the coyotes walking the perimeter wall Waiting for something, waiting for a fall oh, the house is a ship floating on the black sand A drink in the dark trembling in my hand I should go inside I should lock the door But I'm looking for something than something more high confidential there's nobody lived here nobody but me the water is glowing like a me sign I'm crossing over the invisible line and I see a shadow in the water but now I'm going to. Pool it looks so close at night Like I could reach down touching the drain it's perfectly still on a Red Bull like a mirror waiting to breathe Waiting to breath. Honey sharp. Still learning still learning this radio game. So, okay, a couple of things. Let's quickly set up my microphone. You know, as I mentioned over the last few shows, this is kind of Radio stations are not easy. Experimenting in trying to build a radio station from scratch. And by the way, it's my version of a radio station. It's not a real radio station, right? But then again, what is real anymore in this, in this day and age? So anyway, a couple of things. You are listening to Sunshine fm, Modern Media for Palm Springs, Coachella. Basically, my experiment in how a simple human, that's me, armed with an army of AI agents, can maybe put together an entity, in this case a radio station or a modern media brand. And in anybody listening, your case, how can you use AI in your business? How can you use AI in your enterprise? How should you use AI? Or the bigger question, should you even use AI right now? I happen to believe that there's very little we can do about AI taking over everywhere we live, work and play. But I'm open to having the discussion from anybody in our region that has other views, other opinions about AI. The good, the bad, the ugly. This. What I want this to be, is an open space, a safe space where the conversation should at least be taking Place I've been working with. I shouldn't even say working. I've been trying to get the leadership class in the Palm Springs Coachella region to embrace AI almost two years now. It's been all over two years. So I have my own opinions about where we should be embracing it and how it should be implemented. But that's just one person, right? And that's me. So who am I? I'm Sat. I'm the founder, I'm the program manager, I'm the engineer, I'm the AI agent, creator, developer, basically the, the jack of all trades and the master of none. But the good news is I do have a couple of agents that I've created who are the opposite of me, which are. They are the master of all trades. So we'll evoke them momentarily. This, this segment of the show that I call Connecting the Dots is again, everything is an experiment. So even this segment is an experiment and the experiment goes something like this. I pick a topic that I think is pretty important, pretty powerful, pretty timely in the world of AI, in the world of let's say startups and startup ecosystems and businesses. I deep dive into it and I evoke my AI agent who currently is called I.O. and I.O. takes this information, does some research on it and then provides me with usually the facts. But you know, sometimes the facts are only as much as they that are published on the Internet. So IO will bring back the data and the trends and we'll have a kind of back and forth now until IO actually has a voice and a developing that because again AI is. We're pretty early in AI and the voice and audio, which is where I love to play the voice. Real time agents right now still not quite there, but they're getting there. And so soon, hopefully in the next few months IO will actually have a voice. Until then I will just be reading IO's responses to the questions that I feed it in real time. So if you are new to AI, some of this might be foreign. Welcome. Please make yourself at home and do your best to research a little bit more about what I'm presenting. If you are already experimenting with AI, and that might be the 350 of you that joined our workshops last year at AICV. If you are listening to this again, thank you. You will know what I'm talking about. You already have ChatGPT downloaded, you're already working with Claude Code, you're already working with Google, Gemini, you might be working with Xai, Grok, deepseek, Manus, genspark, all these other great AI tools at your disposal. And so what I've done with my agent is it will take the information that I feed it in terms of the topic. It'll come back with the through line and some data and some trends and some information that I may not have access to right now. And then we'll have a conversation where I will ask it questions directly in its, let's say, chat interface, and I will read out their responses in my own voice. Again, I'm not going to be trying to put on different voice. It'll just be me. So it'll get a little kind of janky, I guess is the word, because I'll be both talking as myself and talking as the AI agent. And then we'll wrap it up and we'll go back to music. Now, I say that the whole point, not I should say the whole point. Sunshine FM is going to have 24. 7 music at some point. And it's the only radio station in Palm Springs Coachella that will have 24.7ai generated music and jingles and interstitials and station IDs, because it's just me. And in between that music, it'll be me coming through live, either by myself, me and my agents, or me and actually another human who. Who we want to have a conversation with in town. And I say in time, it'll have 24 7. Right now, we're a long way off. I have a portfolio of really, in my opinion, some great tracks. And keep in mind, none of this is radio professional. None of this is meant to be a podcast. You have plenty of choices for podcasts, plenty of choices for radio stations, even plenty of choices for TV and streaming, if you want. I am just hoping that you'll join me in this experiment as one of the only safe spaces to have the conversation about AI and to talk about the pro and the cons about this world that we're heading into. Okay, so Sunshine fm, Modern Media for Palm Springs Coachella. That's our station id. Today's topic. It's going deep. I don't necessarily want Wednesday to be deep, but maybe de facto middle of the week. It will be a deep dive into a deep topic. And you'll know what I mean when I tell when I read out the actual headline, why Billionaires are Building Bunkers While Schools Still Don't Teach AI. Yeah, that pause was on purpose. I'll read that again. Why Billionaires are Building Bunkers While Schools Still Don't Teach AI. Reason why I bring this up is because if you're into AI, one of the podcasts you might, you listen to a lot of podcasts. One of the podcasts that you listen to might be Moonshots. Moonshots is hosted by Peter Diamandis and he and his co hosts generally are one of the few podcasts that are on the, let's say, bleeding edge of where the AI future could theoretically and in some of their co hosts mind needs to go. And it's pretty wild. I mean, I'll tell you, even I cannot imagine some of these concepts that they're already talking about as though they are here. So it's just a timing issue in their mind. And some of the futures that they talk about, again, way beyond my pay scale. Hopefully some of you who are listening to Peter Demandis and his Moonshots podcast will get a lot more to it. Anyway, his latest episode that I'm still working through is a conversation between Peter and Tony Robbins. You may know Tony Robbins, the self help guru who's been doing the same stuff for 50 years. It's a long conversation, it's a deep conversation and it's revealing something that has been, that's basically been bothering me for at least the last two years, something that I've been trying to get through and obviously not doing the best of jobs to the leadership class here in Palm Springs Coachella with basically zero moving the needle. So here's the setup. Peter Diamandis and Tony Robbins are talking about AI disruption, job displacement, the speed of change, standard stuff, right? But then they get into what's actually happening right now and there are two parallel universes happening simultaneously. So stay with me on this, okay? As I say, I'm still working through it myself. In one universe, billionaires, the people who actually understand the implications of AI are building bunkers, not metaphorically, literally buying ranches, securing water, energy, food systems. They are building for a future they think might be chaotic. They're preparing their families for instability. This was them talking on the podcast, right? This is not me just being conspiracy. This is them talking on the podcast about some of their friends who are billionaires doing this. In another universe, the same billionaires and Tony Robinson, Peter Diamandis include themselves in this, are frustrated that their children's schools don't teach AI. So they're building private academies, private trainings, startup programs. Because the education system, the public schools, even some of the private schools and the universities, well, they're still having the same conversations they were having two years ago. Now I put that in there myself because that is My experience over the last two years, it's the same conversation I've been trying to have with local leadership in the Valley. And so the dot that I want to try and connect today is that there's something fundamentally broken about a system where the people with the most information are literal, literally preparing for bunkers and simultaneously begging the education system to catch up. And because it's not catching up, they're taking things into their own hands and they're teaching AI in their elementary schools, in their middle school, in their high school, and the university kids. And we're not doing that in Palm Springs, Coachella. So my first question that I'm going to ask directly, and I'll put it in right now, we'll get it. We'll get the response right away is my question to IO is this. Peter and Tony are both teaching their kids AI in private academies because the public school system isn't doing it. Meanwhile, they're also talking about billionaires by building bunkers. How do you square that circle? What's actually happening here? Okay, so put it in and let's see what my agent comes back with. Okay, that didn't take long. All right. And by the way, I've. I've kind of prompted IO to give me kind of three sides to every story. The optimist side, the doom gloom side. And possibly where I might land most the time is that truth in the middle. Right. Three sides to every story is one of the mantras I've used ever since way back when. And by the way, quick fun fact. Three sides to every story was from a lyric by Don Henley. All right, so IO's response, optimist. The bunker talk is just worst case scenario planning. Smart people hedging their bets. What's actually encouraging is that Tony and Peter are also investing in education. They're not giving up on the future. They're building capacity both in infrastructure and in human capital. The fact that private academies are emerging means innovation is happening, even if it's not happening in traditional institutions. Okay, I get that. The doom gloom side. Here's what you're actually seeing. The wealthy have decoupled from the public system entirely. They've given up on waiting for government or institutions to adopt. Adapt. That's the real signal. When billionaires build bunkers and private schools simultaneously, they're hedging against systemic failure. They're saying in quotes, the system won't adapt fast enough. So we're opting out. If the people who understand the applications best are preparing for chaos. That's A warning sign. Oh, wow. Okay. There's your doom, gloom, and here's the truth in the middle. This is. This is me also kind of riffing as well now. Okay, Both things are true. The bunkers are real, not because they think apocalypse is coming, but because uncertainty at that scale demands redundancy. The private academies are also real. And they're emerging because institutions are slow. And here's the thing, slow institutions eventually respond just much, much later than they should. I guess that's where my kind of frustration is. Right? The gap between billionaires are preparing and schools are catching up isn't a bug. It's a feature of how change actually happens. Early movers build a new thing, institutions eventually adopt it. There's always a lag, and that lag is painful for everyone in between. Hmm. Okay, I know a few people in town who are going to want this conversation. So if you're listening, reach out and let's have this conversation. So the DOT to connect that I see is the education gap isn't a mystery. It's structural. Schools are designed for stability. AI is acceleration, and you can't redesign a ship while it's sailing. Okay, I never thought of it that way, but that is interesting. All right, so the two years I've spent having this conversation with, let's say, the leadership class in Palm Springs Coachella, and where I feel like nothing moves, it's not like they don't know. They kind of know, but the incentive structure just doesn't reward moving fast on this. Okay, I haven't thought of it that way. That's interesting. Okay, fair enough. So let me ask another question. Here's a question that, by the way, these questions I've kind of prepared ahead of time so I can just copy and paste. So my question of pasting into IO's chatbot is the billionaires can afford to experiment because they have resources and skin in the game. Schools cannot afford to experiment. Or more accurately, the incentives punish experimentation. If that is true, what does it actually mean for students who don't have access to private AI academies? Are we creating a two tier future? And by the way, I put that in right now. It's going to come back with a response. I only have three or four questions today, just so you know. So hang in there. Okay? All right, so I.O. says, here's the optimist. Take to the question about are we creating a two tier future? Actually, no. What's happening is that open source AI is democratizing access. You don't need to be rich to learn Claude or ChatGPT. Kids in public schools can access these tools for free. The disadvantage isn't access to the tools is that they're not being integrated into their curriculum. But that's actually solvable. A good teacher who understands AI can teach it with free tools. It's not about money, it's about will and training. Okay, I kind of, I can buy that. The doom and gloom take is we're absolutely creating a two tier future, but not for the reason you think. The wealthy don't just get access to AI tools earlier. They get permission culture earlier. Their kids grow up in environments where experimentation is encouraged. Failure is seen as iteration and building is the default. Meanwhile, public schools kids learn to follow rules, pass tests, and fear failure. By the time access democratizes, the kids with access are already three steps ahead because they've internalized a different operating system for their brains. Oh, that is. Okay. I haven't thought of it that way, but I can, I can see that. For sure, I would word it differently, but that's a, that's a great way of framing it too. So here's my three sides to every story. The truth in the middle. There is some nuance to this, right? There's an access gap forming. It's not about the tools themselves. It's about confidence and culture. A student who's been building with AI since age 10 approaches work differently than a student who encounters AI for the first time in college. The tool doesn't matter as much as the mindset. Yeah, I totally agree. And here's the encouraging part. Mindset can be taught. Yes. Amen to this. It just requires institutions to decide it's worth teaching. Yes. Two years I've spent doing basically preaching this to basically an empty church, I guess. So the DOT to connect the real wealth gap isn't access to AI, it's early exposure to I can build mindset. And that's something schools could actually fix, but they'd have to reorganize around it. And, and you know, and here's the thing. Behind the scenes, maybe they are. Maybe Palm Springs Unified School District is doing this. Maybe some of the other school districts or some Cal State and uc, maybe they are also doing this. Just from the layman, that's me. I don't see it. When I talk to the kids in high school and, and in university, I ask them if they're being taught this in school. They are not. I know that Cal State is right now kind of training and teaching and educating their faculty before they roll it out, but you know, we are talking about two, three years since Chat GPT rolled out. It shouldn't be taking this long. That's just my opinion, that's just my frustration. So we'll carry on. Okay, here's my third question. And the third question, the way I wanted to try and figure this out was if we actually decided to build an AI native education here, what would that actually require? What's it going to take? So I go ahead and cut and pasted that into my agent IO and it's already come up with a response. But before I read out the response, it's what I spent this, this concept of, okay, look, if the existing educational system from middle school, high school, and then going into the higher education has to move slowly or chooses to move slowly, or incentives are not aligned that they end up moving slowly, this includes the cities and the chambers and the councils who are also part of this whole leadership class. Right? If they're choosing to move slower than, let's say AI is accelerating. I spent 2025 with workshops, AI workshops. We ran about almost 30 workshops, had about 350 people, students, attendees come through because we thought, hey, let's. If they're not gonna do it, let's do a private version of this and let's get people going. I think it landed pretty well. It just doesn't scale because we need more than 350 people in one year to really move the needle, right? We need 3,500 minimum, maybe times up, maybe times a thousand. We need a lot more people going through these, let's say, workshops and courses and salons to, to have the conversation to demystify the promise and the peril of AI. Anyway, I sidetracked there. So here are the answers from IO, the three perspectives. The optimist side about what is the actual move to try and get education and training integrated into everything that we do in Palm Springs. Coachella. The optimist version. Three things, visionary leadership, capital and permission. You have some of the first two in the Valley. That's interesting. We do. You have philanthropists, you have entrepreneurs, you might have people who understand AI. A properly funded pilot program, maybe a middle school or high school where AI is integrated into every subject called. Could prove the model works. Okay. And by the way, if anybody's listening that knows that this is happening in a pilot program somewhere, please reach out to me and let's have somebody join the show. We'll have that conversation. Then you scale. Within five years, the Valley becomes known for AI native education. Talented families move here, startups, cluster around it, you've basically created the hub that you've always wanted. Okay, this is the optimist side. And says within five years, I'll just put a pin in that. The doom and gloom take is this. It won't happen because the incentives don't align. Philanthropists, even philanthropists, want roi. School admins want stability. Yep, I've seen that in my own eyes. Teachers want job security, not revolution. Okay, that's pretty funny. If there's any teachers listening, let me know if that's true or not. And you'd face massive resistance from unions, accreditation bodies, parents who think real education is what they experienced. You'd also face regulatory nightmares. Trying to build an alternative education system is like trying to land a plane while it's flying. Too much friction. Okay, I didn't quite get that. IO you need to work on your. Your metaphors. Okay, I didn't quite get that. Too much friction. I got. All right, so three sides to every story. The truth in the middle. Well, it could happen, just not at scale, immediately. Yep, that's what I experience. What's actually feasible is starting small. A pilot program, a summer academy, by the way, we did a summer academy. We did our 12 week summer school of AI every Saturday. Thank you to all those people who gave up this Saturdays to be part of the workshop. That was four and a half hours of your Saturday. Much appreciated. There's a lot of learning for all of us. A partnership with a Cal State or the like, where students learn AI implementation alongside their degree. Yes. That needs to happen. Absolutely. Right now. Not a complete replacement of traditional education, but a parallel track that proves the model works. Yeah, I agree. That's what we tried to do last year. I'm not sure if we moved the needle. Once you have proof of concept, students who come through the program have better job outcomes, more agency, different thinking patterns, then you can talk about systemic change. You build the future in the margins first, then it spreads. Okay, I can buy that. The DOT to connect. I guess the thing that we're missing in that kind of optimist side, which I put a pin in, is permission. Okay. And that's what I've run into. I don't think people are providing permission for this to happen. So the DOT to connect the move isn't to overthrow the education system. It never was IO, it never was. It's to build a proof of concept that proves the old system is incomplete, then let the market decide. Yeah, I get that. I get that. Okay, so. All right, so let me close with what I've still been working through this morning, listening to the podcast that I mentioned and now, you know, learning live with everybody who's listening to this. Some of the, let's say, other sides of the argument or debate or conversation that I even. I wasn't really necessarily thinking of. Right. So in closing, putting all this together, the bunkers that billionaires are building aren't just about doomsday prep. They're about optionality. We have a friend that all she talks about is options. Anyway, it's a different story. They're saying, I'm preparing for uncertainty by building resilience, and also about making sure my kids are positioned for any future. I mean, at the end of the day, that's what we all want. We just don't. We just don't have that much optionality. The education gap, we're seeing, the lag between what's possible and what's being taught. That's the real signal. Not because it's a threat, but because it's an opportunity. You know, I really do wish more and more folks in positions of power would actually follow through with their desire to integrate AI with actual action and permission and resources where it counts. For Palm Springs Coachella, the opportunity is right here. We could be the place that figures out AI education, not by fighting the system, but by building an alternative that works so well. People choose, requires vision, requires capital, requires someone, maybe multiple someones, to say, we're building this here, we're proving this works, and then we're scaling it. And while I would agree with that from two years ago, two years later, those someone or someones are still using the right words, but they're not following through with the right action. Anyway, I know that today was a little bit on the deep side, and if you got any value out of it, if you have any points that you want to contest or confirm and want to have a conversation around, reach out to me. Every week, we do a summarized email of all our shows. Get on that list and just reply to that email. And I read everything. Right now, when I say I, I mean my agents read everything, and then they give me the summary. But, you know, as we get busier, I'm just preparing for the future. Who actually reads the email anymore? Come on, tell me. Are you really reading your email? And are you even writing your own emails? You've got agents to do that now, right? That's the future we're heading into. So we need to figure out how it fits and what value we get out of the work we do. So yesterday I finished off with a song, talking about music, right? Music was one of my. I mean, music. Everybody is a universal language. It's everybody's love, right? I was in the recording industry back in the day, and this is the reason why I'm doing a radio station of short sorts, because it is a passion project and it fires me up. I get up, I jump out of bed, and I cannot wait to work on this experiment, right? So, music. Let's go back to music. I've created a couple of fantastic, let's say, AI artists, and I'm trying to make it more local, more Sunshine fme, as it were. And I'm going. If you tuned in early this morning, you would have heard some of it. I'm going to go ahead and close out today's show with another one of our AI agents, actually, AI artists, their music. You've been listening to Sunshine FM Modern Media for Palm Springs Coachella. We'll be back tomorrow at 11:11 with more signal. Now, if you're thinking about how to solve the education gap locally, or if you're building something that challenges the status quo, get in touch. This is your radio station for reals. Sa. In a pose I learned from a magazine Checking my reflection in the water Keeping the edges clean I hear the ice melting in the glass Faster than the thoughts inside my head Thinking of the lovers that I left behind and the things I should have said Everyone is floating in a suspended state of grace But I'm just hiding behind the sunglasses Trying to save my face Is strictly poolside confidential A diamond that doesn't really shine I'm trading in the truth For a sip of expensive wine and if I only could swim away from here I'm just a shadow in the water Trying to disappear the waiter brings a dream with a paper shade Just a Another prop for the masquerade I hear them whispering secrets behind the hedge Wondering if the woman in the chair Is standing on the ledge I feel like an actress who has forgotten her own name Looking for a way to exit before the ending of the game the palm trees are swaying like they know how I feel Caught between the glamour and the things that are real Strictly poolside Confidential diamond that doesn't really shine I'm trading in the truth For a sip of expensive wine and if I only could swim away from here I'm just a shadow in the water Trying to disappear in my way or is this just a mistake? The water is blue but none of it's true none of it's true. Just a shadow in the water. Swim, Sam.
