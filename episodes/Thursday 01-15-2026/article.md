HEADLINE: Desert AI: Big Tech's Power Play, Super Bowl Swings, & Our Valley's Vibe Check

---

Hey gang,

Sat Singh here, rocking the mic from the SunshineFM studio (aka my home office). If you're new to this experiment, welcome. If you’re back, thanks for riding along. SunshineFM is basically me, one human, trying to figure out how to build a modern media brand for Palm Springs/Coachella using all the AI tools I can get my hands on. We’re learning in public, so some stuff lands, some stuff… well, we’re still tinkering.

This week’s vibes are a mix of corporate chess, a pivot in AI marketing, and a continued head-scratch for us here in the desert. Let's dive in.

First up, Microsoft dropped a bomb that has ripple effects for anyone watching energy prices and data center growth (which, if you live near one, is basically everyone). This last Tuesday, **Microsoft basically said, "We're paying for it all. Not subsidies, not tax breaks, full cost."** They pledged to cover higher utility rates for their data centers.

Now, on the surface, that sounds like a win, right? No more communities freaking out because their power bills jumped 267% in five years (that’s not a typo, folks). Microsoft says they'll absorb the costs. But is this brilliant economics, or just really good PR? They were kinda pushed into this by the current administration, probably because midterms are coming and folks are feeling the pinch on electricity bills. Here in Palm Springs/Coachella, we don't have a giant data center *yet* stressing our grid (though I'm digging into intel about one potentially coming to Coachella). But even without it, if you're on SoCal Edison like me, you've seen your bill climb. So, while it's a big move by Microsoft, I'm skeptical. Are they just paying their way out of a problem they created, or is this a genuine long-term shift? If you’re an expert in energy costs or data center builds, DM me. I wanna learn more.

Next, get ready for the Super Bowl. If you've been listening, you know I'm all about that shift from "magical thinking to systems thinking," a phrase I totally stole from the CEO of Mistral. Basically, AI companies are done trying to sell you on AGI and super intelligence. Instead, they're going for utility. **"They're stopping this narrative about how powerful it's going to be and they're going to start showing more and more the utility."** We're talking everyday help: cooking recipes, writing emails, finding a good book.

OpenAI is reportedly dropping $16M+ for a 60-second spot. Anthropic (makers of Claude, a foundational LLM model a lot of engineers use) spent $16.5M on sports ads last year, and their ads are all about utility, not hype. For us in the desert, this is huge. Many of us, especially entrepreneurs and small business owners, are *already* using AI for email, social posts, brainstorming. But we're also hitting brick walls, realizing it's more of a slog to integrate than the hype promised. The Super Bowl ads are about normalizing AI, getting mainstream America (and our locals) to see it as a helpful tool, not a sci-fi monster. Will it move the needle on sales? Maybe not directly. But for brand awareness, saying "Hey, we're ChatGPT, and we're here to stay"? Absolutely.

And here's a kicker: a lot of these Super Bowl ads? They're being made *with* AI. I've seen some – mostly I could take 'em or leave 'em. Creativity is tough. But it'll be interesting to see what hits and what doesn't.

Finally, let's talk about Google. If you're in their ecosystem (Gmail, Photos, Search, YouTube), you probably saw they just launched **personal intelligence, connecting all that directly to Gemini.** This is genuinely useful, not hype. It's context, right? Gemini understands your emails, calendar, searches. The catch? It's opt-in. You have to actively turn it on.

This is where it gets spicy. On one hand, it makes life easier. On the other, it's the "creep factor." As I said, **"There's a fine line between a technology company having a most complete AI picture of you as a person... there's definitely some promise to that. And I can also see where the creep factor can come in."** I gave up social media years ago for privacy, but ironically give all my info to Google. Trust is key. For local small business owners and founders in Palm Springs/Coachella, think about this: if your customers are giving all their info to Google, what does that mean for *your* business moving forward? We’ll dive deeper into that soon. And for those newly minted millionaires from SF/LA eyeing the desert, this is the kind of trust vs. utility conversation you're used to having.

This all circles back to something I've been saying for two years: our local leadership here in Palm Springs/Coachella needs to take AI seriously. I heard the Mayor of London talking about AI, saying **"The impact of AI on London's labor market will be nothing short of colossal. And that is likely an underestimation."** He basically said we have a moral, social, and economic duty to act, or risk becoming a weapon of mass destruction of jobs. I could swap "London" for "Palm Springs/Coachella" in that quote, and it would still be accurate for the conversations we should be having. Yet, I still hear leaders in our resort town say AI won't affect hospitality. I remember when hotels removed concierge desks. That wasn't AI, but it was tech and business models changing. Saying it "won't affect us" feels... naive.

So, where are we with all this? AI capabilities are getting more powerful by the day. It's less about the tech itself, and more about who you trust and who controls the information. For SunshineFM, it's about asking how a human and AI can collaborate to create something meaningful, with taste and creativity.

What do *you* think? Are you opting into Google's personal intelligence? Do you believe AI is just good PR for big tech? Reply to this newsletter, or DM me. Let’s keep this conversation going.
