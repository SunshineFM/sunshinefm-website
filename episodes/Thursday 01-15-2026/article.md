HEADLINE: Palm Springs Tunes Into the Future: Sunshine FM, an AI Media Experiment
---
Good morning, Palm Springs and Coachella! A new sound is gracing our airwaves, one that promises not just music and local insight, but a fascinating glimpse into the future of media. Welcome to Sunshine FM, a cutting-edge modern media brand for our desert communities, and at its heart, a bold AI experiment.

Launched by a single human, this ambitious project demonstrates how artificial intelligence can be leveraged to build an entirely new business from the ground up. Sunshine FM isn't just a radio station; it's a living laboratory exploring the capabilities of AI in content creation, curation, and even interaction. As the host candidly puts it, the goal is simple: "Here's a dream. I want to create a modern media brand. How do I go about it using AI?"

Currently featuring a lunchtime show from 11 AM to 1 PM, Sunshine FM blends music with "local intelligence and news from the world of AI business startups." The vision is to create a "safe space for conversations about AI's impact and disruption" on how we live, work, and play in Palm Springs and Coachella. The host, deeply invested in this topic, acknowledges both the incredible "promise and the peril" of AI, from solving humanity's biggest medical crises to generating "entertainment slop." These nuanced discussions will be a cornerstone of the programming, inviting founders and anyone interested in AI to share their perspectives.

Listeners can expect innovative segments, including "Connecting the Dots," where the host will engage with an AI-powered research and journalism agent named I/O. While I/O currently operates behind the scenes, the long-term plan is for it to have its own audible voice on air, engaging in live conversations. This isn't the only AI agent in play; the host even uses an AI to summarize hundreds of newsletters daily, keeping abreast of critical information without drowning in emails.

Sunshine FM openly embraces its experimental nature. Operating from a home studio with "one human and many AI agents," it's "not meant to be a professional podcast or a professional radio station." This is "building in public," a transparent process where the team will undoubtedly "get some things right and most things wrong." But that's precisely the point: to learn, adapt, and innovate in plain sight, making Sunshine FM a vibrant signal for AI and startup news and views in the region.

Tune in to Sunshine FM to be part of this unique journey as Palm Springs steps into the AI-powered future of media.
