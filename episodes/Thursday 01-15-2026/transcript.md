Check 1, 2. Palm Springs to each other. Good morning. Good morning. Today, Thursday, January 15th. That was Ronnie playing a couple of songs and also doing the station ID for us this morning. That's part of the whole experiment of Sunshine fm. And if you've been listening so far, thank you so much for returning. Sunshine FM is modern media for Palm Springs Coachella. Mostly an AI experiment on how one human like myself can utilize AI to, to create, to either augment a business or to create a brand new business from scratch. And Sunshine FM is the latter. It's actually an experiment in. Okay, here's a dream. I want to create a modern media brand. How do I go about it using AI? Very simple. That's the concept. So the plan right now is we're doing a lunchtime show, basically like an 11 o' clock to 1 o'. Clock. It'll be filled with music and then local intelligence and news from the world of AI business startups and inviting founders and anybody who's got any interest in AI to come onto the show and let's discuss it. I want this, I want this space to be a safe space for conversations about AI and how it's going to impact and disrupt how we live, work and play in Palm Springs Coachella. And there's. There's a promise and there's a peril. And if you listen to my TEDx talk that I did last year, you'll know that I myself am kind of pretty conflicted about the promise and the peril. I think a technology that can, let's just say, for example, solve some of humanity's biggest medical crisis, such as, you know, you name it, while at the same time it's just basically entertainment slop on Twitter and your Instagram feeds, you. You two are going to be conflicted. It's both. The promise of AI is amazing and then the challenges that we have with it are just as important for us to have a conversation and discussion about. Anyway, so welcome Sunshine fm. There's a few things I want to get into today. The formats that we're trying. I've been hearing a couple of folks DMing me and some are landing some. We're still just working it out. This is not meant to be a professional podcast. This is not meant to be a professional radio station. This is purely an experiment out of a home studio with one human and many AI agents. So we'll get some things right and most things wrong. But that's the whole point of building in public and having Sunshine FM hopefully be that signal of AI and Startup news and views and reviews. And I'm really looking forward to having conversations with other folks in the region who want to have this conversation. So one of the formats that we tried a couple of days ago and actually have for the last few days is I've built a research and let's say journalism trained agent called I.O. and I know it's weird when you see it, it makes sense. It's I slash O when I say it out loud, it's like it's kind of lame, but whatever. I O is the agent's name and I will. I'll have a deep topic to discuss in our segment called Connecting the Dots, where I'll where something's popped up in my radar, whether it's on podcast or my newsletters. You know, if you're like me, you subscribe to a hundred newsletters and most of them go unopened. The good news there, by the way, is I actually have built an agent that reviews all the newsletters and then gives me summaries in the morning at 7 o' clock and in the afternoon at 3 o'. Clock. And the rest of the time I don't really pay attention to email much. Those people that need to get a hold of me, they, they know my cell phone number, they can get a hold of me anytime they want. So something that pops up my radar that I think is kind of interesting that I would like to bring up to everybody's attention or whoever's listening in Palm Springs, Palm Springs, Coachella. And then I'll go ahead and have a kind of conversation with I O In time, the I O will have a voice that you can hear on radio right now. This is the janky part of it is I will actually feed it the question on air live in one of my LLMs of choice. And the agent will go ahead and come back with hopefully what I call three sides to every story. The techno optimist side, the doom gloom side, and hopefully somewhere where the truth lies, somewhere in between. And if it's worth me chiming in, I will. Otherwise we'll just basically riff off of what of what a slash I slash. Even I can't get the name right, right. IO comes back with okay, excuse me. So. So later in this segment, Connecting the Dots will be a little bit of a deep dive about modern media. But before that, a few quick hits. I'm not sure if you read the news, if you didn't. This is why hopefully you're listening. Microsoft, it made a power move. And what I mean by that Is this. This last Tuesday, Microsoft basically said, we're paying for it all. Not subsidies, not tax breaks, full cost. And here's why that matters and why it's not as simple as it sounds. What I mean is this. Here's the commitment that Microsoft made about data centers in energy. Brad Smith, Microsoft President, just pledged the company will pay higher utility rates to cover the electricity costs of its data centers. Basically, when a data center sucks up power, Microsoft pays the bill, not your electric company, not the residents. That's Brad Smith's commitment. So why is this news today? If you've been at all paying attention to what data centers promise, and they were promising many years ago and have been and continue to promise cities and regions all over the country of jobs and obviously building and building on hopefully unused land, right? Not repurposed land. The promise was a lot of money coming into the area over the last 12 to 18 months. There have been a lot of communities in the US Pushing back on some of this because areas near these data centers that have popped up have seen power costs jump by about 267% in five years. That is not a typo. 267 communities freaked. Homeowners have freaked. Politicians have got angry. Microsoft's announcement is basically damage control. They're saying, we'll absorb the costs so you don't have to. Now, having said that, this is kind of brilliant economics. Smith has said that we need to recognize reality. The public will not and should not expect taxpayer dollars to subsidize companies. He's also saying that federal government can help with permitting and land use, but electricity, water and local jobs, that should be on Microsoft. But here's the kind of the read between the lines kind of the story. That's why I wanted to kind of bring it up. Is this just really good PR or is he hiding a real problem? Because Microsoft is just the first person that's come out and said this, we more than likely expect all the other foundational models, hyperscalers who are building data centers, to also have to play this game. And so if you're a free market proponent, which, you know, a lot of people put themselves up as free market should do what free market does. This kind of makes sense, except for the fact that Microsoft was kind of pushed into this by the current administration because, let's face it, midterms are coming. Not that I'm going to get too political, but reality on the ground is midterms are coming. There's a big pushback on AI. There's definitely a Pushback on data centers. And because people are feeling the pinch at the electricity bill, we don't have a data center in Palm Springs Coachella. But even without the data centers, if you're in Southern California Edison, if you're like me, you've seen your bill go up and up over the last five years for sure. I can only imagine what it must be like in data center in areas that have data centers that are basically stressing out their power grid. And now Microsoft, who've been pushed into it, by the way, by the administration to do something about this. And this is their version of doing something about it. So again, are they trying to pay their way out of power prices and is this just purely a PR move? Again, I'll leave it to you to do some research and make that kind of consideration. I coming from the brand world, yeah, I think it's a pretty good PR move. So the quick hit on this one is Microsoft. Pay attention to it. They'll. They'll most be the first of the big companies to start saying we'll subsidize everybody's electricity rate bill. Doesn't make much sense to me. But I'm sure there's more nuance to this. So if you're an expert in energy costs and data center build, reach out, let me know. I'd like to learn a lot more. I know I have a little bit of a deep dive coming over the next few weeks about a data center that's supposed to be built down on the east side of Palm Springs Coachella. The. I mean, I'm doing some research on it. I don't have all the answers. I know it was made. It made the news a year ago. I'm trying to do some deep dive into what is the reality. I haven't driven out there, but apparently a data center is coming to Coachella. As soon as I get more real information, I will be sure to push this forward. So hit number two, by the way. Normally I would have a little interstitial here, right? A nice little, nice little kind of sound effect to let you know I'm moving to the next story. Kind of like a podcast, but I haven't got that ready yet. Something just arrived in the mail yesterday, actually. What is it? Let me pick it up. Hang on. Yes, here we go. It's a MIDI pad controller so I can go ahead and go live and start hitting some, some pads that will give me those sound effects I'm looking for. Again, I don't want to make this too radio. Right. I have different ideas of what radios should be or the kind of radio I want to listen to. Okay, hit number two. This is kind of powerful. I heard a great comment from the CEO of Mistral. Mistral is a hyperscaler based in Paris. It's Europe's number one foundational LLM model. And you should hear him speak. He's pretty funny. He's got a obviously French humor. And he used this wonderful term called, by the way, his company was built in this format already. So for the last two, three years, he's been watching from the sidelines how the American hyperscalers are marketing. And his term was, yeah, it's about time that we moved from magical thinking to systems thinking, which I thought was pretty funny. I might, I might go ahead and borrow some of that stuff. I say that purely because get ready for Super Bowl. The super bowl is around the corner and the news on the street, at least in the AI marketing world, is that they're moving from the hype cycle to utility shift. So give you a little bit of overall kind of context, AI companies spent $426 million on TV ads last year. That's three times what they spent in 2024. But very few are talking about the, about changing the world anymore. Remember, it was all about AGI and super intelligence. Well, now they're just showing you your day, basically how AI can help you during your day. So the key point is, is this. If you've been watching some of the Google commercials over the last year and even Claude Anthropic, they were actually pivoting from raising billions of dollars by saying we are going to be like God mode in AI to helping everyday Americans live their life, be more convenient, be easier, such as cooking recipes, helping me write that email, help me find a good book, etc, etc, right? That's the boring things that they don't necessarily talk about in VC meetings, but that is exactly how they're going to get mainstream Americans, as it were, to adopt AI. So the super bowl is an opportunity for them to change that narrative. Because the folks I talked to right here in Palm Springs, Coachella, we're already, we've already been using AI for email, both writing and reading, helping with social posts and blog posts. Whatever writing, whatever creativity you're doing, you're using AI at some, in some manner. If you're like most people I speak to in the Valley, you're hitting some, you're hitting some brick walls, you're hitting some cul de sacs, as it were. Because AI promised so much in Reality, it's more of a slog, meaning it's more difficult to really get it in as part ingrained, as part of your workflow and your work processes. And that's okay because it's going to take some time. But in the software world, it. It's already moved mountains. Right. I have a deep dive on how AI is impacting software and engineers in the coding world. We'll get to that hopefully next week. Coming back to the super bowl, half of Americans are still very nervous about AI. And a recent study that came out that they had five different levels and only one in 10 are actually excited about AI. So companies have to do something about it and what they're coming to and my kind of like takeaway on this is there's. They're stopping this narrative about how powerful it's going to be and they're going to start showing more and more the utility. You've already seen it with the Google Gemini ads, I think. OpenAI I got a quick glimpse of their, of their super bowl ad and yeah, it's, it's a very, very polished ad, but it's definitely more just about utility. The business logic behind this is this Anthropic, for those that know, is the maker of Claude. Claude is a fantastic foundational LLM model. Most engineers and coders are using Claude code over most any other foundational model. Anthropic spent $16.5 million on sports ads alone. And it seems like small numbers compared to the billions that they're raising, but still, $16.5 million on advertising, that's a lot of money. And their ads are again, totally about utility over hype. So February 8th, Super bowl, it's in three weeks. The cost is $8 million for 30 seconds. That, by the way, doesn't include production. And I think from the resources I've been watching, Open AI is buying 60 seconds. So basically two. Two commercials. And are they going to move the needle in terms of more people going to get to chat GPT? I don't know. I'm not sure if a Super bowl ad actually moves people to action. What a Super bowl ad does do, though, it separates the folks that, let's say, don't have the. How can I put it? Don't have the. The word I'm looking for escapes me. Maybe the, the permission right now to go that big. Super bowl ads are to show people you're serious, then they're there to show that, yeah, I don't mind spending $16 million on an ad. The hope is people will be talking about it. If it's a good enough ad or funny enough ad, people will talk about it. Does it move the needle in terms of sales? Not really, but it does move the needle in terms of brand awareness and to say to the public, hey, this is OpenAI. You may not have heard about us, but we're chatgpt and we're here to stay. I think that's the main reason why they're doing that right now. Here's the other piece of why I think this super bowl is going to be a fascinating watch this year compared to other years. And that is AI companies are using AI to make the ads. And now if you expand that, a lot of non AI companies are contracting agencies who are using AI to make those ads. Now most of them that I've seen, I could take them or leave them. Making ads is, is. It's a tough business. It's a, it's for creatives who understand what breaks through. But mostly AI generated ads we've seen. I mean I'm not a big fan in all honesty. Having said that, a lot of people I spoke to over the holidays, they love the Coca Cola ads. I'm not one of them, but a lot of people love the Coca Cola ads. So you know, I think it's tough to say what's going to be a hit and what's not going to be a hit when it comes to ads in Super Bowl. But just know this, 50% of those ads more than likely will be AI generated and it'll be great. I'll, I'll do a post super all ad segment and we'll see what hit well what didn't hit and from an AI and business point of view, okay there's the, that's the end of hit number one hit number two hit number three if you have you if you're an Android user or let not forget Android if you're on Google for anything whether it's Google's YouTube, Google search or Gmail or Google Calendar. If you didn't know this, just know this Google just launched personal intelligence. It's a genuinely useful not hype release. It connects your Gmail, your photos, your search, your YouTube directly to Gemini. Reason why me as a you know I love Google generally in terms of a technology company will set aside the fact don't be evil left their branding a long time ago in terms of utility, you know, connecting your Gmail photo search YouTube direct to Gemini, I think that's, I wouldn't say holy grail, but that's definitely an ecosystem that we in the AI world have longed for. I mean, that is exactly what you want. It's all context, right? Understands your Gmail, your emails, who you're talking to, what emails are coming in, understands your calendar, where you're free, where you're not, what you might be searching. Now, having said that, I've spoken to a few people over the last couple of days about this and there's definitely a mix. Some people are excited. A couple of people I know are genuinely not excited about this at all. If you give it permission. And by the way, this is the important part about this, right? It's opt in, meaning you may already have it on your, on your Gmail account, whether it's on app, on your, or your laptop or your desktop. But you have to opt in right now, it's turned off. So make sure you go to Settings and opt in to Gemini. I can see how it, there's a, there's a fine line between a technology company having a most complete AI picture of you as a person. There's definitely some promise to that. And I can, I can also see where the creep factor can come in. But you know, I'm not making any judgments here. Everybody does what they're going to do. I, I got out of social media almost a decade ago because I didn't like what was happening with social media back in the day and what it was doing to really the younger generation. But at the same time, you know, almost hypocritically, I do give all my information to Google. Not that I trust it any. Well, I guess so. I guess that's what it comes down to, right? I trust it a bit more than I trust Facebook and Meta. And so Google knows me the most, I would say, right, because I search a lot on there. My Gmail's on there, my works, Google workspaces on there and my calendars are on there. Giving it, giving its Gemini, which is it say I. All that information, all that data, you as an individual have to make your own choice about that. Does it make your life easier? In some ways, yes. Are you saying here's all my data to make my life easier? Yes, that's basically what we're saying. So if you're a local in Palm Springs, Coachella, if Google knows your life, I think what I would love for you to, you know, email me back with when you get the newsletter, just point of reference. Every weekend we deliver a summary of the week's radio shows in a newsletter. So if you're subscribed you can always just email, hit reply and email me back. Any thoughts you have about the week's shows or any of these points, let me know. If you're a small business owner locally or a founder, do you think this is useful for you as an entrepreneur? Is it concerning? But think broader. If you know that your customers, your clients are giving all the information to Google, what is that going to mean for you as a small business going down the road? I have a few ideas about what it, what it's going to mean and hopefully later on in the next couple of months we can deep dive into that as well. Most people who are on, who aren't on Gmail, they are going to be either on Microsoft Outlook and Hotmail or they're going to be on Apple, right? And we're all been waiting for Apple with their counter move and I know they've made a an agreement with Google to provide their AI services, Gemini, basically a scaled down version of Gemini to Apple and Apple Siri. But I, I imagine in the next couple of weeks we're going to see Apple with its counter move. It's going to be challenging. It's going to be interesting to see how they do a privacy first on device. We don't see your data kind of narrative. I think a lot of folks who are on iPhones appreciate the privacy that Apple offers and what they don't appreciate is that Siri is still pretty dumb chat bot, right? But this year 2026, the promise is Siri will get smarter and the goal there, it will live on your phone, not an Apple's server because that's what Apple is promising, right? So really what all of this really comes down to is AI capabilities are just getting more and more powerful. Not just with Google and all the other foundational models, but it's really going to come down to trust and control. Who do you trust and who controls the information and the content that you're being exposed to or you are opting into saying I trust you, I want you to control this. I think that's pretty powerful. Google by giving it an opt in clause is saying we're going to make it useful. You control what it accesses. It's only five buttons. I'm not sure how much control you have. Apple I believe is going to say here's again something useful. We're not going to see it at all because it's locally on your devices and it'll be interesting to see how actually I wouldn't even say how people are using it at some point, you're either going to be an early adopter or you're going to adopt this stuff later on. It's just, that's just the way it's always been. So those are kind of three little. Actually let me do a quick another one too. Something that's just popped up too. If you've been listening to me for the last few days, actually all last year too, you'll know one thing that I'm always, always banging the drum on is local leadership in Palm Springs, Coachella. This entire valley has to embrace AI in some manner and take it seriously. I've been saying this for two years. We ran about 30 workshops at Cal State all last year in 2025, had about 350 people come through it in the summer, in the fall, and even as of late December, the conversations that these leadership in leadership positions in the valley, it was the same conversations we were having two years ago. They were saying the right things. The action didn't follow. So I'm hoping, fingers crossed, that leadership actually follows through with action. I'm not sure if that's going to happen, but you. Because the action is just not enough and it requires a real commitment, real resources put towards wanting to upskill and reskill and up level everybody in the valley, especially the younger generation. You heard me talk yesterday about the challenges of education and how wealthy folks are setting up their own private academies to teach their kids AI. And whereas the rest of us, when we're not in that ecosystem, we're waiting for traditional educational ecosystems to catch up and they are slow walking, or let's just say put it this way, their incentives aren't aligned and they're walking as fast as they can and it just doesn't keep up with AI. And so a news article that was kind of interesting came from my hometown of London where the same exact conversation and the same frustration was being had by the mayor of London talking about AI. Impact will be colossal. Let me read something from Sky Sport, Sky News. The labor mayor says there will be a moral, social and economic duty to act with a choice to make. And he quoted as saying seize the potential of AI and use it as a superpower for positive transformation and creation, or surrender to it and sit back and watch as it becomes a weapon of mass destruction of jobs. He goes on to say the impact of AI on London's labor market will be nothing short of of colossal. And that is likely an underestimation. He suggests that without proactive action, old roles may disappear faster than new ones are created. He also went on to say that entry level jobs are likely to be the first to go. And unlike the industrial revolution, those in white collar jobs will feel it the the most, which will include some of London's biggest sectors such as finance, professional services and the creative industries. And he basically has gone on to say that he wants to put London forward as a global leader in AI, saying the tech shaping the future needs to be made in the capital with our values hardwired into the code. Now I could have just copy and pasted that and changed London to all the cities that I've been talking to for the last two years. I could have put their names in that article. And the exact same conversation, warning and promise of what we should be doing about this has not changed one iota here in Palm Springs Coachella. I say that because if you're listening, Yes, we're a resort town. I heard a leader in one of the resort organizations saying it won't affect hospitality. Okay, fair enough. That's an opinion. And I basically say it won't affect hospitality until it affects hospitality. I remember back in the day hotels had concierge desks, you know, manned by two or three concierge. Those are pretty much gone. At least the independent concierge department. Yeah, the five star hotel still has has them. But if you go to most hotels, the concierge is just part of the front desk. And I remember when they started removing the concierge desk at some of the resorts, then I did some work, work with. And while that has nothing to do with AI, it had everything to do with technology and obviously profits and business models changing. And I get that. But you know, for you to say AI won't affect hospitality, well, okay, that may be true. Who knows? I don't know, don't know the answers. All I know is Sadiq, mayor of London, saying the exact same thing as the mayors and the pro tem mayors in Palm Springs Coachella two years ago, one year ago. And as as of January 2026, that story has not changed much at all. So where are we? We're at 11:45. I think I went long on my quick hits. Here's what I'll do. I'll finish up with a couple more quick hits and we'll do a deep dive connecting the dots tomorrow. Golden Globes. If you watched it, if you were one of the 8 million people that watched it live, couple of things that kind of occurred to me. One, right away I kind of, I was on a group chat with a bunch of creatives in Hollywood. We were going back and forth about this. There was not one mention of AI Very interesting. I think, while I. I don't know what to think about it, actually, because weren't the strikes a couple of summers ago all about AI and they wanted protection. Well, this summer those contracts are due for renewal again. And will AI be in there? I would imagine so. If they're not. If AI wasn't even mentioning the Golden Globes, even just in the Hollywood, let's say, conversations in public, I have a feeling that it's almost like everybody's. I wouldn't say rolling over, but it seems like AI is becoming a normalizing, even in the Hollywood creative world. Right. Do I want that? Yes, I want that. Do I want that at the expense of my friends who are in the creative industries? No, I don't. Now, do the business models exist where, you know, a dozen of my friends can still have gigs? I would. I would like to think so. It really comes down to consumer behavior. Right. In my opinion. But that's a separate story. So Golden Globes AI wasn't mentioned. And I'm just. Yeah, again, conflicted about this. I think AI is going to be. As we start normalizing AI in terms of the entertainment that we're looking for. Yes. I love the conversations that I have with my friends who say people are still going to want humans to act. Yes, I agree with that. People still want humans to talk over them over the airwaves like this, as opposed to an AI agent. By the way, that's coming soon. People will still want to hear stories experienced by humans, written by humans, directed by humans. Yes, I get all that. I think there will still be a lot of us who still want that. I just fear that the mass market is going to be kind of conditioned to accept AI ads and creativity in almost every touch point. I mean, look at this. Sunshine FM is an experiment in AI now, hopefully, what I'm going to try and do is I fear. I feel as though I do. I'm someone that has good taste, creativity, and I'm putting together a radio station that I would want to listen to. And maybe this is just a radio station for one, and maybe that's where entertainment and the creative industries go. I don't know. I hope not, because I think that is causing fragmentation, furthering the fragmentation of everything. So how can AI and a human work together, collaborate together? That's what I hope the future of Hollywood is as well. The other thing that was kind of interesting and I would love to get your Thoughts on this? Send me a DM or reply to my email in the newsletter over the weekend. Is Predictive markets. You know you saw Poly Market on Golden Globes. Personally, not a fan. When sports betting started happening in my Premier League back in the day, I I thought, oh, this is fun. Let me go ahead and wager a few things on Man City or Arsenal or whoever. And I found myself looking at the what I was betting on versus enjoying the game now. Obviously it's just my version of it. I got out of it real quickly. I'm number one mountain gambler, don't bet that much and it took away the enjoyment for Premier League. I know sports betting is a huge, huge market globally and right now in the 30s odd states that it's legalized in US prediction markets. Poly Market's not legal right now, but it will be this year. Kalshi is legalized prediction markets. And I felt as though showing the Poly Market predictions on the Golden Globes was kind of. Kind of ick. There's a bit of ick. I just felt as though, well, first of all, whoever who, who still list who still watches the award shows. Yeah, I get that. But then having the AI and prediction markets creep in there, I don't know, just. It just felt like, okay, we're expanding from sports to you can bet on everything. Which is, by the way, that's what Kelsey says. I can bet on anything and everything. And I'm not against prediction markets. I just hopefully curation and taste will win the day and we'll have Prediction Market showing up in the right places. Then again, who am I to say what's right or wrong? Right? I'm just here to let you know what's happening with AI in Palm Screens, Coachella and how this wonderful little experiment of how a human can utilize AI and its agents and its assistants and Personas and co hosts to create a modern media brand. What that means, I have no idea. What I do know is a couple of things. Let me leave you with this. A couple of plugs. Even though we ran a ton of workshops last year, I I have a my company actually has workshops that we do for mid size and enterprise clients. Because what we've learned over the last 12 to 18 months is that the technology is not the bottleneck. The bottleneck is cultural. And what I mean by that is it's the people and it's the culture that the comp. The organization has set. There are various department heads, there are various executive team members, and then there's the entire workforce. If everybody is not on the same page, it doesn't matter how much money you spend on AI tools and agents and agentic workflows and work processes. You will you will basically stumble, and it will just be a waste of time and money. And you'll have meetings after meetings. And six months from now, you're going to scrap that playbook and start again, or maybe 12 months, depending on how much money you're trying to put into this. Again, the bottleneck is not technology. The bottleneck is culture. We run a workshop. If you're interested, email the just email on the newsletter or pass this on to somebody else who you think might be interested. And with that, I'm going to go ahead and play us out today with Ronnie, who's one of the wonderful artists, and we'll follow that up with Emmy, who's another great artist. Let me know what you think of those.
