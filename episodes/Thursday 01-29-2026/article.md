Hey,

This is Sat. Just wrapped another show trying to convince the desert that the AI revolution isn't coming – it's here, sitting at your kitchen table, and we're all pretending it's not.

## The Great AI Denial

You know what really struck me today? I had these conversations this morning with people who are literally embarrassed about using AI. Like they're sneaking around, trying to hide the em dashes in their emails because God forbid someone thinks they got help from a machine. 

Here's the thing that's driving me nuts – we're all using spell check, right? Grammarly? That's AI, folks. Has been for years. But somehow we've convinced ourselves there's this moral line between acceptable AI assistance and... what, exactly? Being productive?

I'm sitting here with my wine thinking about how absolutely ridiculous this is. It's 2025, not 2019. The cat's not just out of the bag – the cat has taken over the neighborhood and is running for mayor.

## The Music Nobody Wants to Admit Sounds Good

That song we played at the top? Pure AI. Generated it last night. And yeah, if you're my son or a serious audiophile, you can tell. But I was at an event today listening to what I thought was the regular playlist, and honestly? Half the time I couldn't tell if it was human or machine. The new artists all sound like they could be AI anyway.

Which gets me thinking – are we protecting artistry, or are we protecting our egos? Because there's a difference, and we need to be honest about which one we're actually defending.

## The Coachella Valley Problem

Here's what's keeping me up at night: we're being so... Coachella Valley about this whole thing. Playing it safe, staying in our lanes, waiting for someone else to figure it out first.

I spent two years trying to convince our leadership to take this seriously. Moved the needle about as far as a shopping cart with a broken wheel. Meanwhile, my friends in SF are about to cash out of their AI companies and they're looking at Miami, Austin, Colorado. 

Why not here? We've got 350 days of sunshine and the space to actually think. But we're stuck in our nine-city fiefdom mentality while the future is being built around us.

## What's Actually Changing

Claude just dropped this new interface called Cowork. If you're not technical, imagine having a coding partner who never sleeps and doesn't drink your coffee. If you are technical, you know this changes everything about how we build software.

But here's the real shift – we're trying to bolt AI onto systems that worked in 2020. It's like trying to add rocket fuel to a horse and buggy. The whole business model has to change, not just the tools.

The companies that get this are quietly rebuilding from the ground up. The ones that don't are going to wake up one day wondering where their customers went.

## The Uncomfortable Truth

This experiment – Sunshine FM, this whole thing – might fail spectacularly. But at least we're failing forward instead of succeeding backward.

We need a thousand startup experiments happening in this valley. We need spaces for career changers and creative entrepreneurs and anyone who's figured out that AI isn't the enemy – it's the writing on the wall.

Because whether you like it or not, whether you're ready or not, AI is reshaping everything. Your choice is whether you want to help steer or just hang on for the ride.

Talk soon,
Sat
