What are we listening to? Well, you're listening to Sunshine at FM Modern Media for Palm Springs Coachella. Now, what is this? This is an experiment. Hey, Thursday, good afternoon. This is sat. I am the human behind the mic. And this is an experiment in AI. And let me explain, right now I'm working with several foundational models. And if you're in the AI world, you understand what that means. It's a ChatGPT by OpenAI, it's Claude by Anthropic, it might be Google, Gemini by Google, and obviously there's several others, but those are the three most prominently used ones in the us and right now I'm working with Claude, which is the AI from Anthropic, to build this, not just show, but this radio station, Sunshine fm. And I'm trying to do this. And hopefully the feedback I've been getting, it's been pretty, it's been interesting to say the least, but at the same time, it's kind of positive. And what I mean by that is I'm not hiding the fact that we're using AI, right? Sunshine FM right now is the only radio station or even modern media brand that is 247 AI generated music, content, information, education and updates. Interrupted here and there by my daily weekday show, which you're listening to right now, 3pm Pacific. And throughout the day, when there's some kind of interesting or breaking kind of AI news, either locally or, let's just say, more nationally. Right? And if you're in the AI bubble, it is difficult to keep up. You know this. Every day there's several stories that we could break in. And right now, as we build this radio station out, when I, by the way, when you hear me say we, it's me and an army of AI agents, automations, assistants, companions. We'll, we'll get to companions one of these days. That's my kind of like my. That is kind of like my deep dive. I've been doing a lot of research on, on this for the last couple of years. Definitely more so last year when I did a TEDx talk about this. And I think that's where we really need to be having conversations in the valley, across generations. So when I say we, it's me and an army of agents. This, this experiment is to show everybody in the Coachella Valley that we need to have this conversation about AI. We need to listen to all opinions about it, and we also need to share how we're integrating this on a personal level and a professional level and our successes and our failures and where we're getting stuck. And. My learnings over the last two and a half years of doing this new form of generative AI is we have just got to get out of our way. Coachella Valley. There is so much going on in the AI world and I just feel that we are just being Coachella Valley again. So Sunshine FM is me saying, look, not hiding the fact. This is AI. Let's have the conversation. If you don't like it, let's have the conversation. If you love it, get on the station with your AI generated content and your conversations that you want to share with the rest of the valley. And what I'm hoping is that you get to hear how this might work. Because really think about this. This is 2026 and AI is good enough now that pretending you're kind of, let's say, doing everything alone. Like, you know, you're sending out your emails as though AI wasn't involved, or you're writing your LinkedIn posts, your social media threads as though AI wasn't involved. And you're. And I say this, by the way, because I, I spoke to a couple of people this morning and it's almost like they don't want to tell people that they're using AI or they're embarrassed on how they're using AI. And in all honesty, I just feel as this kind of silly now. Okay, don't, you don't need to take out your em dashes from your emails because you don't want people to think you're using AI. At the end of the day, if you're not using AI, you're leaving some assistance, some digital assistance on, on the table. Yes. Still be involved. Yes. Keep your voice, keep your tone, keep your humanity, keep your agency. But you know, let me ask you this, I had this conversation this morning is do you spell check when you send out your emails or your social media posts or even your text to your friends? Maybe not that part, but do you use spell check? And the answer is sure you do. Why do you use spell check? Because you don't want to be embarrassed that you've made some sort of grammatical error. Well, hate to break it to you, but Grammarly and all the spell checks in Google and on iOS, that is AI. So I'm here to tell you it is okay to send your emails and know that as long as you're writing it or you're editing it or you're orchestrating it and you're getting your thoughts across, it's okay to hit send knowing that it was co Written by AI Anyway, again, that's why Sunshine FM exists. I'm here to tell you most everything you hear is going to be co written, co authored, co engineered, co created by AI. Did you hear that song at the start? That is a new Persona that I created last night. And I mean, look, if you're an audiophile, you can tell the difference. If you're my son, yeah, you can tell the difference. But at the end of the day, could that song have been played on a rock station in town? Yes. Come at me if you don't think so. And what I mean by that is just DM me. Get on the show. Let's talk about music. Let's talk about AI generated music. And don't get me wrong, look, I love my classic rock. You know, that's kind of where I was raised and I love that stuff. And what makes me go back to that stuff is because it's. First of all, they don't write music like that. No more than that, do they? And you recognize the artist. But when I go to radio stations or I'm at a. Like today, I was at the event this morning and they were playing music. Again, I've never heard of them. I've never heard of the artists. You know, maybe that's on me, but there might have pretty much the entire playlist I was listening to because I don't recognize the artist. I'm sure that's on me. I actually thought, wow, that's AI generated. And if it's not, it sounds just like the AI generated music that we play here on Sunshine fm. So not that you need my permission, but it's okay. AI is here to help your productivity, is here to help you hopefully bring your better self to work or to play. Happy to have that conversation. And if you attended my TEDX talk last year or if you found it online, look up TedX Rancho Mirage. You also know that I'm not just a 100% accelerationist on AI. I have my. I'm conflicted about it. I think there's a promise, I think there's a peril. And I try and bring all of that energy to my conversations. And I'll get into a little bit more about my conversations that I had this morning about AI a little bit later. But for now, what I want you to know is me, right here, the human. I'm bringing the perspective, I'm bringing my voice, and I'm bringing the things that I notice, not just in the AI world, but living here in Coachella Valley. That's what I'm bringing my my understanding of this region that we live in, Claude and ChatGPT and Google, Gemini and NotebookLM and Cursor and all these other AI tools and foundational models and assistants and agents that I use, well, they bring the research, they bring the speed, and they bring the ability to connect the dots across everything happening in tech and business. And honestly, I find it to be a pretty good, if not great, partnership. So here's what we're actually doing. When I say we, you know who I mean. We're paying attention to how AI is reshaping work, business and life. I'm not here to give you the social media hype version. I'm here to give you what I believe is an opinionated real version. You know, what's actually changing, what people are actually thinking about, the conversations I have on an individual basis and the workshops and the boot camps that we've been holding since last year. I've done over 25 workshops with Cal State University, San Bernardino Palm Desert campus and across a variety of organizations. And I have several clients that we're still early days on. Some of them, some of them have graduated to another level, the next level of AI implementation. And I have a lot of stories about what's going well and what's not necessarily going well and where really the bottlenecks are with my mid mid sized enterprises. And what I'm trying to do here is I'm trying to make this all hyper local, demystify the big AI stories you hear on CNBC or Bloomberg or wherever you get your business news and bring it all the way down to kind of what does that mean for the Coachella Valley? Which is a little bit on the strange and weird side because really there's not much startup noise and activity here in the Coachella Valley. Yes, I know I'll have plenty of folks DMing me and saying they think I was wrong on that, but it's my experience. For the last 20, 25 years there have been fits and starts of startup entrepreneurial ecosystems trying to flare up. But you know, at the end of the day, can you think of a startup born out of the sands of the Coachella Valley? DM me, let me know. I know some of the, some of the brands you might bring up, but again, I would rather have a thousand startup experiments in the Coachella Valley and how can we create a space for all of our next generation workforce and our creative entrepreneurs and our career changes. And by the way, with AI knocking on our door, you are going to have to figure out what you're going to do if AI impacts your industry or your organization. And to me, a real startup ecosystem is what we need to have in place sooner than later. And again, if I'm in the Bay Area or if I'm in Los Angeles or London, it's noisy, the big cities, a lot of stress. And you have maybe about 20, 30, you know, events, AI and technology events happening every night because that's where the density of talent is and that's really, honestly, that's where all the money is. But having said that, I do think that we here in Coachella Valley have an opportunity, but maybe not to get in front of this, but at this point, let's not fall behind. And the fact that there I have the blue skies and sunshine, I think gives me time to think and reflect on what we could be doing. And right now, Sunshine FM is an idea that has been on paper for about three years. I started it a couple of years ago, but then it got really busy for the last two years trying to convince our leadership class in the Coachella Valley to take this stuff seriously. And I personally don't feel as though I moved that needle. And so I'm focusing all my, all of my time mostly on Sunshine FM and my, and my training community, which is aicv. You'll hear me talk about that quite a bit. I will say this, here's a observation I've had, and this is not just local, this is, I'm hearing it from my colleagues in the cities as well. Is most businesses, most companies, actually even individuals. But let's keep it to businesses for now. What I'm seeing them kind of doing is they're trying to bolt on AI onto systems that may, may be working for them right now, but will they still be working for them as we move into a, an AI era? I happen to have the thesis that business models and business processes actually have to change if you're truly going to make the most of the promise of AI. I know a lot of people will agree with me on that. The challenge is it's getting people to actually move and take action in that, in that direction. So I just want people to think about this differently. You know, keep, I guess you can keep reading, you know, your newspapers and your, where you get your information from, you know, Bloomberg, cnbc, wherever. But when it comes to Coachella Valley, I want you to think differently. I think there are actually. I think you need to think differently. How's that? So that's basically what Sunshine FM is All about. It's how AI changes the way people think about work, about building something, something real. But really, when I talk to my friends in the Bay Area and a couple in la, I mean, they are going to be newly minted multi millionaires at the end of this year when some of their AI companies either get bought out or they go public and they're going to be looking at Miami. That seems to be like their number one. Well, not everybody's, but the number one location. They're looking at Austin, they're looking at Utah. Some are talking about Colorado, they're talking about these places because they want to get out of the Bay Area when they have the cash. My goal is to say, you know, you might want to come to Palm Springs Coachella, not because it's a startup scene, but because you can help build that startup scene. I think it's a heavy lift in terms of me trying to convince them, but if they're listening to me on a daily, weekly basis, which they sometimes do, maybe I'll get one or two of them to come over. Okay, so that's what this is. I can't guarantee them the talent pools here, although. Although, I think we could develop him. I can't guarantee them that the infrastructure is here. Although really, if we all got our heads together, we could create that infrastructure. The challenge is everybody's living in their own silos, nine city fiefdoms. And when we talk about Riverside as a county, you know, this Riverside on the other side of the windmills, gets much of the attention. Coachella Valley, blessing and a curse. We don't necessarily get that attention. The only thing I ever promised my friends in LA and San Francisco is here's what I will guarantee you. 350 days of blue skies and sunshine. Hence the branding Sunshine fm Modern Media for Palm Springs Coachella. Yes, this is an experiment. Yes, this is AI. And yes, We may fail, but that's okay. Experimentation requires failing. Again, this is not a polished podcast. This is not professional radio. You have many choices to get those items. This is raw. This is AI. This is me and an army of AI agents, foreign. You are listening to Sunshine FM Modern Media for Palm Springs Coachella. Okay, so if you've been listening for the last couple of weeks, especially late last week and early this week, I was speaking about how Claude by Anthropic came out with a new, let's say, interface on their Mac OS app. And that new interface is Cowork. Now, bear with me. If you haven't used Claude before, visualize this Claude by Anthropic had two tabs. One was Chat. I'm sure you're familiar with it. If you're using ChatGPT, it's the same thing. You're just chatting to an agent, asking your questions, asking you to do deep research, asking you to find you, asking you, you're asking it to write your emails or respond to emails or that good stuff, right? That's okay, that's chat. That's one of the tabs. So you're used to that. What you may not be used to if, especially if you're not a developer, as a matter of fact, you won't be used to this. If you're a developer, somebody technical, a CTO into computer science. You may be using AI to help you code code apps, code websites, code work processes. And you might be doing that on ChatGPT with Codex. You might be doing that with Google Gemini in their anti gravity ide. You might be using other AI multi billion dollar valued services like Cursor or Replit or Lovable or Bolt. You might also be using it in Claude. And I know most of my friends who are developers are using it in Claude. Code in Claude. And what they, what the tab is, is code. So you got these two tabs, right? You got the Chat tab, which is for us normies, and you've got the code for developers and technical folks, right? They just came out a week ago with this middle tab called Cowork. And Cowork is meant to hide some of the coding technical terminal interface, as it were, and the coding commands that you need to learn to code an app or a website. And they've made co work for folks who are, you know, less technical but still very entrepreneurial, less developer friendly and more strategy and marketing friendly. I've been using it for the last week. I'm tripping and falling. But there is some magic with what Cowork can do. Now keep in mind you are giving, unlike chat, with Cowork, you are giving it access to some folders on your computer. And that's where the magic really happens. Because chat is all about getting answers to your questions and Cowork is to actually help you get things done. Anything you can do digitally or on your computer, Cowork can help you get done. That is a big shift between how you might be using ChatGPT right now, but, but it is a shift that you will have to embrace and learn to get in front of and learn how to use this playground, as it were. Because this is where I believe my Thesis is, this is where we're all headed. And if you listen to my. All week long I've been talking about this other service that blew up over the weekend. It's now called Moltbot. That's M O L T bot. With that one, what you're actually doing, it's open source. You're actually downloading it and giving it access to your entire computer if you want it to. And then you're just saying from simple things like organize my file folders and it does it to hey, while I'm asleep, could you go ahead and research everything about my industry that happened over the last six months and come up with a deep report on a web as a standalone website and a PDF document and I'll see you in the morning. And you go to bed and you wake up in the morning before you have your cup of tea or your cup of coffee and malt pot has gone out and done all that work for you and come back and coded and then debugged and encoded again, a standalone website and a PDF just like you asked it to, and it's ready to go. Sounds like magic. That's because it feels like magic. So here's a couple of notes that I'm sharing from somebody else I follow online who's an organizational specialist, Tiago Forte. He has some similar experiences that I had and so we're sharing a couple of them. It feels powerful, thoughtful, thorough and well organized. And I think that's what we're hoping for, right? It's a great alternative to Claude code because it hides the scarier technical aspects that makes code intimidating for beginners. It's something we were teaching last year in my workshops and it's something that we're going to continue teaching in our boot camps in 2026 with Cowork. They've managed to make the coding piece of this more approachable without sacrificing power and functionality. There's a plan mode which is like, hey, don't do anything but just plan this with me. I think that plan mode is pretty powerful. It's hidden, but it's activated automatically when you need it. Cowork seems to favor creating documents or complex along outputs. And I think that's pretty smart because I think that way you can go ahead and actually co create with it. And sometimes it's scary just letting it do its own thing, but when it creates the documents, you at least have this like midway point that you feel like you still have some control. I think it does great job with context and the Most powerful thing, and this is where I might lose some of you, is that skills and tools are still available in cowork, but they're not necessarily essential because a lot of what cowork does does kind of what skills and tools do, but in the background without evoking the skills and tools. So anyway, I just wanted to quickly share that with you because I think cowork is pretty powerful. And if you're a little bit on the, let's say, I wouldn't say scary side, but if you're a little bit kind of intimidated by coding, co work is definitely like a middle ground that you, that I, I think that you should experiment with. Okay, what else made my news? Actually, before I get into. Oh, hang on, give me a second. You are listening to Sunshine FM Modern media for Palm Springs Coachella. Okay, I kind of got that going. Thank you. That's to let you know I'm changing subject. Okay, Changing subject to this morning. I went to an event. It was at the Aquashore Arena. It was to kick off and celebrate CV Giving Day, which is the biggest one day philanthropic event in the Coachella Valley. I believe it's their fourth year. Patrick Evans from KESQ was the mc. There was a surprise guest there. Fuego. And let me tell you, fuego. He absolutely brings the energy and he definitely gets people acting like teenagers. Right. Everybody's screaming in the crowd. I think talking to folks, you know, it can't help it. Right. I. I do ask them how they're integrating AI in their professional life. And then obviously on a personal level. Right. So anecdotally, I thought one of the most interesting conversations I had was with someone who works at a local organization that has, let's just say, about 100 employees. It's an organization that we all know, and it's an organization I've been spending maybe the last 18 months to, in my own way to try and get them on board the AI train, the AI plane, the AI rocket ship. And while the. The words were coming back as yes, we need to and we got to do something, what I heard this morning from the person that works there was he had no idea who was running AI and she had no idea on if there was any AI training or AI documents or AI processes or AI anything. This is two years on, and I'm sharing this story with you because January 2026, if that, if they are any indication of our leadership, organizations and professionals in our community, I'm just questioning. Why do we wait so long before we take action and so when I posed this question to somebody else who also works in a corporation in town, they basically gave me the answers. They said, look, everybody here is conservative, meaning they're risk averse, they want to kind of get guarantees or they want to be more sure before they move. And yeah, I understand that. Everybody wants to hold on to their positions, their titles, their salaries. They don't want to make mistakes. Right, I get that. I guess my frustration is this is when I talk to my pals in the real AI world and how fast things are moving and what kind of impact they believe is happening not in 10 years from now, but in like in the next 18 months or 24 months, I get a little concerned for our businesses and generally more so for our next generation workforce. And how AI is going to impact the careers that they're seeking and the work that they're looking for. Now I'm not saying all work is going away. There was a great article this weekend about, you know, blue collar jobs are safe. It's the white collar jobs that are kind of going to be in the crosshairs. Okay, I can buy that. I was talking to some landscape people this afternoon and yeah, that AI is not going to come in and cut your lawn for you. Right. So blue collar jobs, you're good. And maybe that's what all the leadership class is looking at. Locally. Our big industries are healthcare, agriculture and tourism. I guess most of those are blue collar jobs. I guess the only thing I will say not to actually is it more of a reality check is yes, you're right. In agriculture, healthcare and tourism, mostly service staff, mostly, let's say manual labor, mostly blue collar. Okay, I'll give you that. But each one of those has back office and admins and support staff, customer service on the telephone, customer service on the website, digital connections, all, anything digital, you're in the crosshairs. And I'm only saying this because you need to up level reskill yourself to make sure that you're using AI for those purposes that will augment and elevate your own skill set. That's what we teach in our workshops. That's what I'm doing here in Sunshine fm. You are listening to Sunshine fm Modern media for Palm Springs Coachella. I still don't know how to work that thing. That's okay. One of these days I'm gonna have an AI agent that's going to work that for me and so it'll get better. Okay. By the way, if you're asking, I have about seven different AI agents, assistants Helping me out to put this radio show together. And they're all basically just toddlers. You know, they're. I don't think they've. They didn't exactly know what I'm trying to do here. I mean, some of them do, but most of my agents, they're still toddlers. They're learning how to barely walk. Okay. And that's okay. The whole reason for doing this is experimenting in public, building in public. Okay, So here's a thread that I thought would be kind of interesting. I feel as though this is a conversation I've been having, you know, towards the end of. End of the year, last year and then going into 2026 is it feels like the training wheels might slowly be coming off some AI experimentation. And what I mean by that is this is. We might be coming towards the end of a chatbot era now. It sounds strange me saying this on for I just lamented about how slow everything is. I feel as though, because AI is accelerating at such an exponential pace, that while I still think chatbots are going to be the interface, both via text and what I do here, which is audio, I think audio is the interface of the future. I think that we've been talking to AI. If you're using AI, you basically been talking to AI via text or maybe chat audio. You ask ChatGPT to write a poem, you ask Claude to summarize a PDF. But I think this week, especially from this weekend, I think one thing that's really coming into focus right now is that this year AI is going to start doing the work, not just talking about it. OpenAI has finally fully integrated Operator into the enterprise tier. Anthropic just released their first quarter economic index, and it basically shares who they think is safe and who isn't. And Google is possibly winning the war by making AI invisible on your Android phone. So let's go back a bit. Okay. OpenAI. A year ago last January, January 2025, OpenAI teased a tool called Operator. I was thrilled. I knew exactly what they were going to. What they were doing with Operator. It promised to be an agent that could use your computer for you. We spoke about that earlier. Right. Well, this week that promise is a deployed reality in the enterprise sector. Yesterday there were reports that were surfaced that OpenAI's operator is hitting a wider release for enterprise users. And it's not just a chatbot anymore. It's a piece of software that can click your mouse, open your browser, book your flights, encode entire modules of software without you typing a single prompt. Why does this matter because of Stargate? Now bear with me, okay? Stargate is Sam Altman's $500 billion infrastructure project. Construction is underway in Texas and the news this week is that Sam Altman and Stargate is now discussing expanding that to be a $5 trillion global cluster. Why do you think he needs a 5 trillion dollar scale? And I'm just. For many reasons. But let me on today's thread, let me just put that, pull that thread and tie it to Operator. When these operators can do for you as opposed to just, let's say answer your questions for you. More and more of us are going to be utilizing the doing portion of our AI. And that doing portion requires multiple steps, sometimes hours of steps if you let it run overnight. And that is exponentially more expensive than just answering a question or a series of questions in your chat. And that is massive compute power that they need. So why again is it $5 trillion? Well, let's kind of go back a year ago again when Deep Seek Chinese AI company came out, they dropped their R1 model, which it basically proved that high level reasoning, which is the, the process behind thinking models, they came out last year and they could do, they could do the same thing for 1 27th the cost of OpenAI. And basically as I've been speaking all year long, or last year long I should say, is that destroyed the profit margins for everyone. I mean, think about this. If you're spending 20 bucks a month on ChatGPT or Claude or Gemini, isn't that the best $20 a month you're spending right now? That's a pizza, that's two Starbucks drinks, that's two meals at In N Out burger to access the world's experts on any subject known to man. If you're not spending the 20 bucks a month, what are you doing? So let me quickly throw Anthropic in here. Anthropic developers of Claude, one of my favorite actually. I love them all, but that's one of my favorites. This week they released their data on computer use, which is term that they use for AI taking control of your computer. Anthropic released their report and they basically said that the jobs adopting their AI the fastest aren't the low wage ones. It's the, and there was specific here. It's the 85,000 to $145,000 bracket salary jobs, that's software engineers, UX designers, technical writers. They launched computer use in late 2024. And while it's being used for augmentation rather than replacement, which is what we try and do with everything that we do in our workshops, What they're showing is that it's almost a 50, 50 split. 50% of the time the humans are collaborating with AI, which is what I'm doing. And 50% of the time they're letting it run fully on autopilot. I haven't got there yet. And if you're listening to this, more than likely you haven't got there yet either. But 2026 is going to be the year of experimenting on letting your AI run on autopilot. It's kind of like self driving cars. If you haven't driven FSD or you haven't let the FSD take over your your car, you have no idea what it's like and what it feels like. And the moment you do that, it is scary the first few times. But then I guess you just get used to it. I think that's what's going to happen when, if you allow AI to take over your computer. Now, if you're in a business, don't do this at all. Let your IT people take care of this if they're going to implement this. Knowing how Coachella Valley moves, I doubt anybody in the Coachella Valley is implementing any of these autopilots in their business. However, if you have a spare laptop sitting at home, I think you need to experiment. We're running some boot camps this year to help you get set up and help you use this and show you the magic of this, because we do think it's exponentially even better than the AI chatbots. While all this is happening with OpenAI and Enterprise and Anthropic, with what they're sharing in their enterprise use, Google and Google's Gemini, they finally come back from the dead basically when it comes to AI. And they came out with Project Astray. It's their universal agent and it's slowly being moved into what they have. The, they have basically the magic of distribution and that's their Android users. So unlike OpenAI, which needs you to install an app, or Anthropic, which needs you to use the API if you're using it for business use, obviously Google basically owns the phone in your pocket. And by the way, iOS listeners, Google and Apple made a deal two weeks ago that Google is going to power Google, Gemini is going to power Apple. Siri. So even though I'm talking about Android, Google is on pretty much all the phones in your pockets. It's being designed to see what you see through your camera and remember where you left off and what you're looking at on your screen, kind of weird and creepy, but that's really the three big companies in AI. This is the through line I want to share with you. It's all about context. OpenAI has the infrastructure, Anthropic has the reliability. Google has the context. And I think Google Gemini is finally connecting those dots. And if we were betting on who wins in 2026, most probably it's Google because of the lack of friction. It's just there. OpenAI has to raise trillions of dollars for data centers. Google is just updating your pixel. And when we are looking at this for this year, and I might be wrong, but for this year it's the death of the chatbot and the birth of the agent. Woohoo. That wasn't me that wrote that. That was my co pilot that wrote that. Okay, thank you very much. I don't completely agree this is the death of the chat bot, but it's a good, you know, let's say pipeline, right? I'd love to know what you think about this. Do you agree? Do you disagree? Dme, let's get on the show. Let's talk about this. I think it's important. I think there's. This kind of transition is happening not in Coachella Valley. It's definitely happening in the Bay Area. It's definitely happening with my pals who have downloaded claudebot this weekend and using it to power their lives as much as they can. I've practiced with it and played around with it this week and I'm tripping and falling. But that's okay. I'll get better. As I keep experimenting in the Coachella Valley. I think this is going to happen. It's not going to happen broadly, but I do think little, little sparks are going to start happening. And if you're experimenting with any of this on premise or local AI, reach out to me. I want to learn from you and I want you to be on the show. Let's talk together. Let's talk about this and. And let's let all the other listeners hear about it as well and learn. At the end of the day, we need to learn. You are listening to Sunshine FM Modern Media for Palm Springs Coachella. Oops, I stomped it too early. Oh my goodness. What am I doing? What am I doing? Come on, AI agent, help me out here.

I'm going to leave you with a couple of songs now with one second, actually, third AI artist that is on our I'm going to call it a record label. Yeah, that's right. Third artist signed to the Sunshine FM record label. And that's Emmy. You heard it yesterday with a song. I'm going to sign off today again with Emmy. I think it's a really. Again, Palm Springs Coachella, Coachella Valley themed music. If you're a business in town and you want to partner and you want our AI agents to create music for your business, your brand, to try and let's say, set yourself apart from the other businesses, reach out, DM me and let's put something together. Thanks for listening. Sunshine fm. Modern media for Palm Springs Coachella. We'll talk soon.
