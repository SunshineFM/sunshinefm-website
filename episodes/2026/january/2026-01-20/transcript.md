Sam, It's. Just a guest. Just a tourist. Just a guest. Just a tourist. I love those lyrics, love those lines. Hey, welcome. Welcome to Sunshine fm. This is Sat. Sunshine FM Modern media for Palm Springs Coachella. Today is Tuesday, early, well mid January now, right? It's already the 20th. Oh my goodness, where did the time go? All right, so there's a lot to get into. You are listening to the talk show piece we call AI Talk and Business Radio and there is quite a lot happening in the AI world and the startup world which is what we're here to talk about. And let's get right to it, shall we? There's. We're going to talk a little bit about the ads that are coming to chat GPT. We kind of briefly mentioned it yesterday. We're going to talk a little bit about. Let's get into. I wanted to get into Google Gemini personal intelligence but I'm doing a deep dive in that because I'm right now I've already opted in and I'm kind of experimenting with Gemini's personal intelligence and I think there's a lot of positives but there's also a ton of do. I really wanted to get that much data, that much information. So we won't talk about personal intelligence because I'll do a deep dive later this week or maybe over the weekend. But I thought what we will do. Something I am actually experimenting with and by the way failing on some fronts is we mentioned this yesterday and last week about Anthropic releasing the non technical version of their coding agent which is called Cowork. And while I think it's pretty brilliant in terms of okay, they're setting down the standard or at least the experiment, I played around with it and I've been experimenting for the last, let's say two, three days and I've had some successes and definitely some fails and I'll kind of go into a little bit of that. So a little bit deeper dive into cowork. We'll get into the drama about what was just kind of reported yesterday which is the Elon Musk lawsuit against OpenAI and the judge says yes, this is going to a jury trial sometime in 2026. Just first of all, mind blowing in terms of some of the documentation that has come out. I'm not reading all of it but I am sending out some agents to take that information, keeping on alert and then man, you know, bringing up what I think might be relevant. I mean at the end of the day we could have a whole hour long show just about that. But you don't want to just hear me talk about it, right? Yes. I could bring my agents and we can kind of see what they're talking about, which we will at some point. But I'd rather have another human join this conversation in our region. And let's talk about doesn't matter. You don't have to be an attorney, just have to be somebody with a, let's say, smart insight, some, you know, intelligent take about this and where we were, where we are and where we might be going. Okay, so a little bit about the musk gambit and I thought was interesting. Ben Affleck was on the Joe Rogan show and he talked about AI in Hollywood. I have a local Hollywood writer who's in town and lives here, by the way, and I've asked him to join me and have these conversations about AI in the creative fields, specifically Hollywood. And while in spirit, he said okay, I have yet to actually have him on the show, partly my own deal because we're not quite ready for prime time. Right. Not that we are ever going to be ready for prime time. As you all know. If you've been listening for the many, many weeks we've been on air. This is an experiment in AI and AI radio, actually, modern media, actually. So we will talk about some of, let's say, snippets that Ben Affleck was repurposed on Twitter and on other social medias. And how right is he? How, you know, is he on the right track? Can we, you know, he's, he's in the inside. He's, you know, a producer, a director, a writer and an actor. And you know, I think some of the stuff he says has some weight because he, and he is an insider. So we're kind of quickly deep dive into that. And then I did want to talk about some in my local Intelligence Sec segment, I wanted to talk about what India was doing with their power stations and the infrastructure kind of play. I know it means a lot for let's say, data centers down the road. If you listen to my segment last week about data centers coming to Imperial county and in the Imperial Irrigation District and what that really means for locals, residents and businesses, commercial use of energy and water use. It's interesting when I kind of had my agent dig deep into what Indio has released just this last couple of days about the infrastructure play, while they don't specifically mention data centers or AI, I think it's important that we recognize that there are some cities, number one, who have the capability of let's say land and thinking of the future. As we all know, Indio has a lot of land and a lot of growth potential. It really comes down to the city council and the leadership on what they prioritize. As we all know, there's a 50 all take, top five priority. You can only get so much done. The infrastructure play is pretty long term thinking and so once you go into that, we may not have time. So the other local intelligence news I wanted to talk about is the Palm Spring City Council approval of the convention center expansion. Now I'll leave most of it for that segment, so stick around till the end because I'm going to do something different. Because even when I co wrote it with one of my editor agents, when I was reading it this morning with the coffee, tea and coffee. By the way, PG Tips and coffee is my mix. When I was reading it this morning, it, you know, it didn't sound any different than what you're getting on Palm Springs Post. Congrats, Mark and Kendall. I think you guys do a great job. It's not any different than really what you get on Desert sun or the local radio news stations. So then you kind of wonder then why are you here at Sunshine? Well, part of it is because I'm hoping you want a take, right? You want like let's say an opinion or a personal take as opposed to just a journalistic, editorial, newslettery sort of version. I've gone one step further, so stick around. We're going to go live with something. It's a new way of reporting the news. It may not work. I haven't listened to it myself, just generated right before we got on air. More than likely it's gonna be pretty crap. But at the end of the day, maybe it's an idea that I might dig deeper into. As a matter of fact, it's always been an idea that I've had for a long time. Will it work? Who knows? Okay, normally I would have a nice little station ID here, but you already know Sunshine fm. Modern media for Palm Springs Coachella. Let's dig right in. Let's get right in. I think one of the most important signals that we got from yesterday and carried on to today is the OpenAI ad trap. So here are some verified facts. Okay, OpenAI announced January 16th of this year that ads are coming to ChatGPT. Now they're coming to the free tier and the $8 a month go tier. The testing will start in the coming weeks in the US the timeline wasn't necessarily specified. The plus $20 a month tier and the Pro $200 a month tier and the business and enterprise subscriptions. They remain ad free. The ads will appear at the bottom of the responses and they will at this point be clearly labeled Sponsored. OpenAI explicitly states that ads do not influence the answers Chat GPT gives you. They also state that no ads will be served to users under 18 and no ads on sensitive topics such as politics, health, mental health, etc. OpenAI also promises they will never sell your data to advertisers. Sam Altman previously has opposed ads, calling the idea uniquely unsettling. That was of summer of 2024. A little bit of context about this. OpenAI is on track for $20 billion annualized revenue, but has committed to $1.4 trillion in infrastructure spending over eight years. So the reason for the ads is money. Only 5% of Chat GPT's 800 million users currently pay for subscriptions. And, and even by 2030 they project only 8 to 9% adoption. But keep in mind, by 2030 they're also expecting to have like 2 billion weekly active users. So it's not chump change. Fiji Simo, she's the CEO of Applications and she was the former Meta executive. She's leading the ad strategy rollout. And finally, the market reaction to date has overwhelming, overwhelmingly been negative on social media. Users report feeling betrayed by a loss of clean experience. So let's take the next couple of minutes to have that conversation about the ad trap going line by line here, right? Yeah. You know, it'll start off with a free tier and a new $8 a month Go tier, which is very similar to the one that they, that they had released and offered in India. And so I think it's kind of smart that they're doing it for the free tier because, you know, if you, you know, if you've come from the gaming world, which I do, we sold a company back in the day to king.com and there's two kinds of rules of thumbs. It's either the 80182 rule or the 99. 1 rule. And what that basically means is 99, 90% of your users in social games and mobile games are playing without paying. Right. 9% are actually paying and 1% are your whales. They're like, they don't care. They just pay a huge boatload of money to the game developers. Right. And that's been the rule of thumb pretty much across the board in the gaming world, in the social gaming world. So you basically think in terms of an operator, well, 90%, they're free. Just kick them off. No, because you want that 90% to continue being part of the ecosystem. Because that ecosystem is made up of, you know, lurkers, creators and whales who are major consumers. Right. So this is not a surprise to me. I always figured they were going to go to ads. I think last summer we ran a workshop at Cal State. We talked about that. The only way this is going to work in terms of OpenAI's valuation is ads are going to have to be turned on at some point. I think we all have experienced it with Netflix. You know, Netflix, we loved it because there was no ads. You just paid your 15 bucks or 12 bucks a month and there was no ads. Now there are ads. Same thing with Peacock, same thing with Prime. If you are subscribing to any of these streaming services, it's. It's only a matter of time before they turn on the ad tier. Right now, it doesn't surprise me that right now it's a little bit negative sentiment, but, you know, they have to talk about it at some point. Their PR is pretty good about this. And I imagine a year from now we are not going to be talking about ads so much in terms of why they turn it on. We're just going to learn to deal with, I'm either paying the tier that has no ads or I'm fine getting some ads if they're relevant and if they don't skew the results. I had a conversation yesterday with my son about this concept that can you really trust these big tech companies or even media companies when they say that there is no influence for the search results or the answers that they provide in your. As your chat assistant. And I mean, at the end of the day, they have a lot to lose if Chat GPT loses the trust factor. We, and we talked about this last week too, about at the end of the day, really, all we're going to have left is trust, right? That's going to be the usp. Chat GPT has to be really careful about losing the trust factor. And right now in the AI bubble, they seem to have some trust. What I mean by that is this. Most people I talk to out here in Palm Springs, Coachella, whether it's in the workshops or at events that we have locally, or just in the coffee shops when I'm doing some meetups, they tend to trust the results that Chat GPT gives them, even if it's something as important as their health, which is kind of remarkable to me. ChatGPT is only three years old, yet My experience on the street with most people I talk to who are using Chat GPT by the way, not the ones who are anti AI, is they kind of trust the results or the answers they get back. And I think part of that is also because it's not like a one shot result. Right. You're having a conversation with ChatGPT, so perhaps the trust factor comes because you're asking a question and then you're asking another piece of that question and then you're going diving a bit deeper into that topic or that, you know, certain question that you need answers to. And the trust comes in as you have this conversation, as you direct this conversation, then at the end you're happy or content enough with the answer, you get that the trust is kind of implicit. Whereas Google search, we kind of know that it's genuinely or generally based on keywords and search engine optimization and we've made a deal with Google that says, yeah, just give me the latest information or the, the most relevant information as best as you can. And generally we're not asking it to diagnose our health, we're just saying what's the best pizza Poly Naomi. Right. So I think the trust factor for ChatGPT, they'll have to manage this really well and I'm sure they are, they know what they're doing and it'll be interesting to see if and when they lose that trust crown because they're incorporate, incorporating ads into their answers. The concept of no ads being served to users under 18, that's, you know, again, when we sold our company to king.com back in the day day we were in the, we played in the tween mobile gaming, social gaming arena. And so we had to be held to COPA children's online rules and regulations in the US and they have some other ones in the UK and it's difficult, you know, at the end of the day, I mean, you know, kids are going to be kids, they're going to get around this, they always did with Napster. They get around this with VPNs and they get around this with also, you know, parents okay with opening up an account. So I don't know how they're going to do this. Ads for under 18. Maybe there is something to be said about what, what my colleagues over in Bay Area in these companies, they believe this is optimistic. Take that the inference. The, the, the information that the chatbots can actually take can actually, they can detect if you're under 18 now. Okay, I think that's a great place to be when they get there, maybe there right now, users and consumers will obviously find ways of getting around it. But if that was the case, that's pretty powerful. So we'll see how they, how they actually get there. I would love to hear what you think. I mean, if you're a Chat GPT user, you know, DM me, you know how to get a hold of me. You, you see me out in the streets, just DM me, let me know what you think. If you want to come on the show and have a conversation about ads in not just Chat GPT but all the other AI chatbots because you know, this actually puts pressure on Google Gemini. Is Gemini going to start doing ads in their AI mode? More than likely they're already kind of doing bits and pieces of that. But as Gemini gets more and more entangled into our all the surface areas that we have like Gmail and search and YouTube and calendar and Google Docs, is Gemini going to show ads in those various places? I don't know. I think it does put pressure on them to do something. And Claude, well, they don't haven't talked about ads at all. And so if you got any opinion about this, come on the show, let's talk about it. I can't do this on my own. Okay, so that's the ad trap. Let's talk about another signal that's pretty powerful and that's like really surfacing this weekend and early this week is what I talked about briefly yesterday, which is cowork. Cowork, if you're not familiar, is the Claude code for non technical users of anthropics. Claude, Claude, Canadian Claude AI chat button. And I was excited. I mean I'm not, as you know, I'm not technical. Although I have been stuck in coding hell this weekend based on a bunch of scripts that I co created on, on Claude Code's terminal, which, that's another story. So when cowork came out, super excited, non technical person here, I played around with it and tried to have it take over some of the scripts that I had written with my Claude code. So here are the verified facts about Anthropic's cowork agent. It launched cowork January 12th in Research Preview. Last week it was available to Claude Max subscribers, which is 100 to $200 a month. This week it's available to Claude Pro users, but on a, I think limited version, less tokens. So if you're on the $20 a month, you have access to Claude's cowork. Right now it's Only on Mac only. Lucky I have a Mac in my home studio. So it's a Mac only launch. They said that Windows is coming, but there's no timeline specified. Here's something pretty amazing. They basically said it was built in 10 days, largely by CLAUDE code itself. Pretty meta, right? It has the same underlying architecture as CLAUDE code, which is using the Claude Agent SDK and the Opus 4.5 model. You developers out there who are listening, you know what I'm talking about. Everybody else, that's. That's kind of foreign language. Don't worry about it. Users basically designate a folder on your Mac, you describe a task in natural language and CLAUDE executes autonomously. There is no step by step conversation required. Which is the magic of this, because when you put your task that you've described, it goes off and starts doing everything it can to accomplish that task. Pretty wild actually. When you watch it in action, it runs locally in a sandboxed Linux container on your Mac with production grade infrastructure. Again, gobbledygook for non technical users. Real use cases, as they've suggested, are expense reports from receipt screenshots. You can do some research synthesis, you can file organize. This is the thing that's going to blow you away if you do decide to experiment on this. It actually takes control of that folder that you've described and starts creating subfolders if necessary and files in there. Now just be careful. I'll come back to a couple of warnings in a second. It can document generate and data extraction. So there's a bunch of promises here that we've heard for the last two years, I get it. But when you actually see it on your local computer, it's pretty wild. Users are reporting that tasks that would are taking 10 to 20 minutes, that would normally take two to three hours. That's a time saver, obviously. Anthropic built Cowork largely in response to finding that 95% of Claude code users were already using it for non coding tasks such as research, writing, etc. And so the psychological unlock is we're shifting from I need to do this task to I want this outcome. It's a different way of thinking about it, but as you start actually experimenting with it, it slowly starts seeping in. Okay, hang on one second. This is a bigger unlock than even I'm doing justice on this show. Now having said that, I know for a fact a handful of startups in Y Combinator and just from colleagues of mine who have AI startups around this coding for non technical people, they've raised a ton of money from VCs and angel funds. How is this going to affect them? I imagine some of them are just going to run out of money because they're not going to get follow on funding. Some of them might break through on niche cases but I can easily imagine them this weekend all meeting in their WeWorks and talking about the pivot and what kind of pivot they need to do. If that's you get on the show, let's talk, let's figure out how what you're pivoting to or or if you find this a threat at all. The whole, the whole conversation we've had for the last two years is why are we building these, let's say startups to solve for a certain niche problem when the big foundational models is going to come out and do this themselves. Open question. It's still Greenfield for a lot of us, so I'd be interested to see what you think about this. Again, reach out to me if you've been playing around with Claude code cowork actually, even if you've been playing around with Claude code. Get on the show. Let's talk developer and more technical because I know the clients that I speak to. This is kind of the hurdle that they're running into. And we have a community at AICV of developers and techies that if you are finding yourself stumbling on the technical component of building agents or agentic workflows, you have people in town right now who have the capabilities to help you cross that river. Okay? So get in touch with me, let me know what your problems are and what solutions you're looking for and I guarantee you I'll introduce you to the devs on our AICV team that can fix this for you. So coming back to kind of the challenges I had, as you know, this radio station is an AI experiment in building in public. Last week I created a co created a ton of scripts where it would take the radio show what you're listening to, listening to right now. My goal is that the radio is the spine of the modern media, let's say ecosystem that I'm creating. Fun fact sidetrack here real quick. The conversation I also had with my son was you are going against the grain, going against the trend where everybody lives. Very few people are moving to radio. And while I agree with him and this could be me swimming upstream, you know, maybe and maybe just it's just a great experiment I'm having a lot of fun with and it doesn't necessarily go as big as I want it to be. Meaning, or I shouldn't say big as impactful as I want it to be here for Palm Springs Coachella. But then again, what. Why do I want to be on social media and play that treadmill? Why do I want to play that whole game that really, at the end of the day, 99% of all you business owners are finding yourself having to play. I don't want to play that game anymore. I did that for many decades. Not interested. Going against the green touching grass. Is there a pendulum shift? There's a little bit of an ebb and flow pendulum shift to analog. Is it going to be sustainable? Who knows? That's kind of where I'm kind of betting right Is this is the kind of radio show radio station I should say that I want. Remember, we're early days. This is just the first few weeks of doing this. Let's revisit this at the end of this year and see where we are with that. Okay? Last week it was all about Claude code in the terminal in the CLI, building Python scripts and calling APIs from my various other services. Google Gemini assembly for transcription audio hijack is where this radio station actually records the files, the MP3 files. Radio Co is where this actually broadcasts and GitHub where much of the raw text and the analyze and reasoned narrative all lives again. If I'm losing you, don't worry. All I'm trying to do is I'm trying to show you building in public. I am trying to connect or connect a bunch of dominoes in this simple experiment. About eight different dominoes need to fall as soon as this show is over. Last week it worked Monday through Thursday. The Friday I made some changes and it fell apart. So over the weekend I was in code hell and I also had to like reimagine the workflow Cowork launched. I played around and experimented with Cowork over the last 48 hours. And while Cowork has a lot of promise, it was won't fix this. Let's say seven to eight services or triggers that need to happen for this flow to work autonomously. Right. Part of it is because Cowork apparently doesn't have access to APIs. Who knew? So we tried MCPS and while we were able to connect with the Google Gemini AC mcp, we couldn't connect to the assembly transcription MCP and the hack on that was using Zapier or Make and I'm trying not to do that. I want to go into MCP world McP servers and AI agents and agentic flows. Again, experimenting in public failed big time yesterday in yesterday's show. I'll see if it gets fixed today. I doubt it because I kind of ran out of time. I was encoding hell. So again, experiment, have fun with it. Report back what's working and if you already an expert, even though it's only been out for three days, get on the show, let's talk about it and let's share your knowledge with the rest of the community. Okay? All right. So another AI news that was pretty powerful is the Musk gambit, Elon's lawsuit against Open Air. You're going to hear a lot more about this. Let me just quickly give you the. I won't go deep into this, but let me just quickly give you the verified facts on the ground of what's happening right now. A dozen verified facts. Okay. 1. Elon Musk Co founded OpenAI as a nonprofit in 2015 and he left the board in 2018. He now runs a competitor, OpenAI called Xai, which created the Grok chatbot, which if you listen to my conversation last week is going through a major PR disaster with their, let's just say X rated undressing of minors and celebrities, right? Actually anybody you can undress anybody. So that's Grok. He filed a lawsuit in August of 2024 alleging OpenAI breached the founding mission. The judge just this week cleared the case for a jury trial. Actually it was last week in Oakland, California. The jury trial is scheduled for late April 2026. Interesting timing. Not because of anything in the AI world, but because we would have been done with Coachella and Stagecoach around that time. And also we might be having our follow up Palm Springs AI Tech and Creativity Expo at the convention center in middle April. So we'll be very, very busy with that. Meanwhile, this jury trial is set for late April. So that's going to be amazing. Elon Musk filed and his attorneys files the damages claiming 79 to $134 billion. That's nuts. Now we all know he's going to be a trillionaire on paper in this year. That money doesn't mean anything to him. This is the principle and he's going to make sure this hurts OpenAI and Sam Altman, who he cannot stand. Or at least in social medias, they seem to be having this fight all the time, right? Expert witness C. Paul Wasan, who's a financial economist, he valued Musk's contributions at $38 million in seed funding, which was 60% of early capital. He helped with staff recruitment. He helped with credibility because you know who nobody knew Sam Altman, but they already knew Elon Musk and business scaling expertise. Musk argues he deserves a portion of OpenAI's wrongful gains and that's just for OpenAI alone. OpenAI's counter is this is an unserious demand. It's a harassment campaign because he wants to slow down what they're doing with ChatGPT because he has his own Grok and Xai AI venture. And they've counter claimed that at most Musk's stake is worth $38 million. His original donation because it was a non profit. It's gonna be super interesting and super entertaining to watch where this goes. OPEN AI counters that they have strong defenses. Microsoft is also named as a defendant and, and they've argued that no evidence that they aided and abetted in this move by OpenAI to go from a nonprofit to was it Benefit B Corporation. I think really they didn't aid in the bet. Okay. Microsoft. Oh, that's right. I'm sorry to try and keep it, keep it level. Right. Verified fact number 11. OpenAI sent a letter to investors warning about delay, deliberate, deliberately outlandish claims from Musk during this trial. And the betting markets. Oh, we can't get through a show without talking about Kelsey or polymarket betting markets like Kelsey show 57 odds that Musk wins. Oh my God. And Jim Cramer, if you remember him from cnbc, he's still alive. He's over there. He basically says this is is not a good thing. A good sign for OpenAI if it all goes public, which more than likely it really will. Okay. Anyway, I'll leave it there. There's a lot more I wrote that I wanted to talk about but you know, in the essence of time, we'll leave it there. We'll pick it back up maybe later this week or maybe next week. DM me, send me any information that you want to go into. It's not so much whether you like the characters in this, in this kind of courtroom drama, it's more a case of what are the business ramifications or implications of this. Can you go from a non profit to or for profit? And what is a price you're gonna have to pay if that is going to set precedence right again. We'll go dig deeper in this another day. We will dig deeper into Ben Affleck's comments about AI maybe tomorrow. I do want to quickly mention that there is a follow up small little meetup at tomorrow, January 21st at the Palm Springs Agua Caliente Cultural Museum. This is the second follow up. It's an event put on by the city of Palm Springs, managed by the Palm Springs Chamber and little Pat on my own back here. I named it Future PS and they've lovingly kept the title Future PS AI Tech and Creative Event. It's $40 a person, so it includes some small plates and some wine and beer. They did a good job last last time. It's small group dialogue, non conference. It's for founders, creatives, educators, civic leaders discussing what's working, what's not working with AI adoption. It's about AI literacy in Coachella Valley schools. It's part of the broader AI movement that AICV has been a part of since day one. I can't remember who the, I can't remember who the AI artist is going to be there. Actually, I do need to reach out to her because I want to see if she wants to put some of her music onto Sunshine fm because we are the Valley's only AI generated radio station. So keep that in mind. I'll be there tomorrow and I will report back on Friday about how things went, etc, etc. I think about 50, 60 people showed up last time. Expect the same. All right, so here's the other thing I wanted to quickly mention. A new kind of format. Let me see how it works. I wanted to talk about this is local intelligence segment. I wanted to talk about the Palm Springs City Council approving the how many millions is it the new Palm Springs convention center, right. $135 million convention center modernization. They've got their reasons for doing it. There's also some pushback from residents because of how they're going to fund it. I did some, I had my agent actually do some deep, some deep research on this. So I do have like about 12, actually 10 bullet points that I'm going to quickly go through. But then instead of me talking about it, what I've done is I've fed this into one of my agents that made a diss track out of this and I fed this into suno. And by the way, if you're not using suno, you really ought to. If you just, even if it's just for fun and if you haven't signed up for suno, let me know. I have a fantastic affiliate link for you. And I say that purely because it's those affiliate links that are going to keep this station going. Right. So here are the verified bullets. Right. Palm Spring city council approved 1.1.25 million in design contracts. It's $135 million convention center modernization. It includes a $52 million west side renovation, a $60 million dollar east side expansion, and a $23.4 million pedestrian connectivity improvements. It's funded through measure J, which is a tourism improvement district fund for hope from hotel stays. The folks that they. You don't need to know that. Okay. Architecture, district, urban design, and for branding. I don't know any one of these three companies, whether they're local or they're out of the area. Maybe if you're out of the area, you have better expertise. If they're local, good for you. I love it when you try and keep the funding local. The construction is phased. It's going to go from mid-2026 to mid-2028, and the connectivity work is going to start late 2027. The last major expansion of the convention center was 21 years ago, 2005. The main purpose for this and main push for this is that Palm Springs lost 278,000 hotel room nights between 2010 and 2023 because of COVID and from competition from places like Vegas and San Diego. Meeting planners have cited lack of flexible space and modern technology as reasons for choosing competitors. Fair enough. The city is pursuing a Tourism Improvement District, 1% assessment on lodging, which is $4 million annually, to reduce the pressure on the general fund. The shaded pedestrian connections, they're planned between the convention center downtown, the hotels, Agua Caliente Cultural Museum and the casinos. All right, that's pretty powerful. So I'm not going to read the newsletter article that I put together for this. Here's what we're going to do instead. Here is our diss track. Remember, I've never. I've not heard of this. So you and me are going to listen to this live, right now. Here's the diss track for the Palm Springs Convention center modernization funding. Wait, wait, hold on. Pause the tape. Did I read that right? Okay, I'll bear with me. Okay, I hadn't heard that, friar. It generated the lyrics and it generated the diss track. And I thought it was going to be a back and forth in terms of here's the positive side and here's the let's say, residents being kind of understandably, kind of pushing back against this. Apparently this was a total resident side diss track. Okay, hilarious as it was. Upon apologies to the positive side because there is some positives to modernizing the convention center. I don't think it's all, you know, bad. I think part of this was there was a comment by a council member that said they didn't even know the numbers. And I think this diss track singer took that at heart and said, you don't even know the numbers. Okay. Which I thought was kind of funny. All right, now, it's not funny when it comes to local governance, but Sunshine fm, we're experimenting with AI. So can we do some sort of news and not actually forget news, just local intelligence in this manner? It doesn't have to be a diss track, obviously. I know we're experimenting with a bunch of small businesses in town for ad jingles that are going to be things that are very current, very on topic, meaning it made for today or made for this week or made for this month, which is not easy to do traditionally. But with AI generated ad jingles, is it something we can do? Yeah. Will it be effective? I mean, at the end of the day, if I had a, you know, a hundred thousand listeners, I would imagine pretty effective. I don't have that many listeners. So it's more a case of who's actually listening, who's really here, who's here for the experimentation, who's here for the learning, who's here for watching other people experiment with this and then thinking how this might, you know, work for your own business, for your own startup, for your own enterprise? And where can AICV and Sunshine FM come in and help you with our community to help you understand, demystify AI? But also, where are we with AI with artificial intelligence and the agents and the workflows and the MCP servers and the coding? What can we do together? And instead of you trying to learn this on your own, on YouTube, how can we, as a community, locally, in the Coachella Valley, in Palm Springs Coachella, how can we work together to make the most of this? So our future generation workforce actually has an opportunity to get on the career ladder locally. You've been listening to Sunshine FM Modern Media for Palm Springs Coachella. We'll see you again tomorrow.
