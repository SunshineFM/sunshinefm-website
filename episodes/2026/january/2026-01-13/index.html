# Local Intelligence: Stop Waiting for AGI — The Real Transformation is Happening Now

**January 13, 2026 — SunshineFM Local Intelligence Report**

Everyone's obsessed with when AGI arrives. Nobody's paying attention to what's already shipping.

I spent Tuesday morning doing what I call "Connecting the Dots"—pulling signals from podcasts, newsletters, and my own experience working with businesses here in Palm Springs Coachella, then asking my AI agent I.O. to help synthesize what's actually happening beneath all the AGI hype.

---

## The New Internet: The AGI Obsession is a Distraction

Paul Reisetzer said something on the AI Show that stuck with me: "We don't need to reach AGI to completely transform business, the future of work, and your own work."

Think about that. Everyone's chasing the finish line (AGI). Nobody's paying attention to the actual race (useful AI shipping today).

Here's what I'm seeing in the data:
- Claude Code is shipping. Gmail is adding AI. Agents are here. Agentic commerce is real.
- Billions of dollars are flowing into hundreds of startups building on top of existing AI models.
- The transformation isn't waiting. It's already happening.

The psychology is clear: "AGI is coming" is easier to talk about than "AI is incrementally useful across more domains every month." One sounds dramatic. The other sounds like work.

But here's the insight: The people winning right now aren't the ones waiting for AGI. They're the ones asking, "How do I use this today?"

## Local Intelligence: Why Palm Springs Coachella Leaders Are Stuck

Here's my frustration after two years of conversations with local leadership:

I've been trying to get entrepreneurs, city councils, and business leaders in the Coachella Valley to move on AI implementation since 2024. The conversations in January 2026 are identical to the conversations from December 2023.

Same language. Same hesitation. Same waiting for clarity, legal approval, or perfect readiness.

Meanwhile, the entrepreneurs and curious experimenters who went through our workshops last year? They're just moving. They're not waiting for permission.

**The multidisciplinary advisor concept matters here.** 

A real estate broker used to need:
- Tax attorney
- Structural analyst  
- Market researcher

Now? Upload the lease agreement and property data to Claude. Spend 20 minutes. Get 80% of the analysis. Have a real conversation with the expert about the remaining 20%.

That changes the economics of running a small business locally.

**The uncomfortable truth:** Competence is becoming a commodity. The companies winning aren't the ones with the smartest people anymore. They're the ones who figured out how to orchestrate people plus machines.

---

## Community Comments: The Human Becomes the Filter

Here's what I.O. helped me understand: The human doesn't become obsolete. The human becomes the decision-maker.

You stop being the executor. You become the filter. You stop asking "Can I do this?" and start asking "Should we do this?"

That's more valuable. But it only works if you actually move.

The people at risk aren't the ones AI can theoretically replace. They're the ones waiting for permission while the world shifts around them.
