# Local Intelligence: Billionaires Are Building Bunkers While Schools Still Don't Teach AI

**January 14, 2026 — SunshineFM Local Intelligence Report**

There's something fundamentally broken about a system where the people with the most information are literally building bunkers while simultaneously begging the education system to teach their children AI.

That's the paradox I explored Wednesday after listening to Peter Diamandis and Tony Robbins discuss what's actually happening in Silicon Valley right now.

## The New Internet: Two Parallel Universes

**Universe 1:** Billionaires who understand AI's implications are building bunkers. Not metaphorically. They're buying ranches, securing water, energy, food systems. They're preparing families for instability because they think the future might be chaotic.

**Universe 2:** The same billionaires are frustrated that their children's schools don't teach AI. So they're building private academies. They're creating private AI training programs. They're taking education into their own hands.

Here's the dot to connect: When the people with the most accurate information are preparing for chaos AND simultaneously opting out of the public education system, that's a signal worth paying attention to.

## Local Intelligence: The Education Gap is Structural, Not Accidental

The real insight: This isn't a mystery. It's structural.

Schools are designed for stability. AI is acceleration. You can't redesign a ship while it's sailing.

The wealthy can afford to experiment because they have resources and skin in the game. Schools cannot. The incentive structure actually *punishes* experimentation.

**What I've experienced locally:** After two years of conversations with Palm Springs Coachella leadership about AI integration, the response is always the same:

"This is important. We're thinking about it. We need to move carefully."

And nothing moves.

**But here's what's actually happening:**
- Private AI academies are emerging globally
- Wealthy families are teaching their kids to build with AI at ages 10-12
- Public school students encounter AI for the first time in college (if at all)
- By then, the gap in *mindset* is already established

The tool access gap is solvable. Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini are free. The real gap is cultural. It's the "I can build" mindset versus the "I follow rules" mindset.

**What could change this locally:**
- A pilot program proving the model works (summer academy, middle school integration, Cal State partnership)
- Permission and resources from leadership
- Proof that students who come through an AI-native curriculum have better outcomes

We ran 30 workshops in 2025 with 350 people. That moved some needles. But you need 3,500+ people going through meaningful AI education annually to actually transform a region. We're not there yet.

## Community Comments: Permission is the Bottleneck

Here's what I keep running into: People in positions of power say the right things. They don't follow through with action.

They have the capital. They understand the signal. They're not moving.

If you're a student in Palm Springs Coachella not getting AI education in school, that's not your problem to solve. That's a leadership problem.

If you're a parent frustrated with this gap, reach out. Let's build an alternative that proves the old system is incomplete.
