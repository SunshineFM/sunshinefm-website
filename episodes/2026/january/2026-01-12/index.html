# Local Intelligence: SunshineFM Sonic Experiment — Building the Audio Identity

**January 12, 2026 — SunshineFM Local Intelligence Report**

This Monday was the music broadcast.

If Sunday was the "Hello World" moment, Monday was the first experimental dive into what SunshineFM's sonic identity could sound like. The entire broadcast was music—AI-generated tracks, jingles, station IDs, and creative explorations of what a fully AI-native radio station sounds like.

---

## The New Internet: AI-Generated Music as Radio Content

The Recording Academy just updated its rules: AI-generated music can be nominated for Grammys, but only if it includes "meaningful human authorship." Pure AI with no human input is ineligible.

What SunshineFM is doing is different. Every piece of music on this station—every jingle, every interstitial, every backing track—is AI-generated. But it's being curated, directed, and selected by a human ear with specific taste.

Is that meaningful human authorship? Maybe. But more importantly, it's an open question we're asking live, on air, every day.

---

## Local Intelligence: The Future of Radio Production

Here's what matters locally: One person can now produce a full day of radio content that would traditionally require dozens of people—music producers, sound engineers, jingle writers, talent.

The tools exist. The workflow is real. The economics change everything.

For entrepreneurs and creatives in Palm Springs Coachella wondering how to launch something without a traditional budget or team structure, SunshineFM is the proof of concept. Not perfect. Experimental. But functional.

The question for local business owners: If this is possible for media, what's possible for your business?

---

## Community Comments: What Does AI-Generated Music Feel Like?

The honest answer: It's polarizing.

Some people find AI-generated music innovative and fresh. Others find it soulless, derivative, or technically impressive but emotionally hollow.

Both responses are valid. That's why SunshineFM exists—not to prove that AI music is *better*, but to ask: What does it mean when one person can create something that used to require teams?
