# Local Intelligence: AI Model Wars, Neural Interfaces, Agentic Commerce, and the Data Center Coming to Our Region

**January 16, 2026 — SunshineFM Local Intelligence Report**

The frontier model wars are over. What comes next isn't smarter AI—it's deeper integration into the layers of infrastructure that run business, retail, and daily life.

This Friday, I spent the morning analyzing the signals that matter for our business community here in the Coachella Valley. Who's actually winning the AI wars, and why should we care? Why is a $250 million bet on neural interfaces relevant to us? How is Google's new commerce protocol going to affect small business here? And most pressingly: what does a $10 billion data center proposal 15 minutes away mean for our region's future?

Here's what I'm seeing.

---

## The AI Model Wars: Specialization, Not Domination

OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google have carved up the market. The question isn't "whose AI is smartest?"—it's "whose infrastructure runs the apps I'm building?"

Here's what I'm tracking:

OpenAI dominates consumer and small business ($6.8B in 2024 SMB adoption). Anthropic is quietly eating OpenAI's lunch in enterprise (IBM, Deloitte, Accenture, Travelers chose Claude for security and reliability). Google is winning the infrastructure game—they own Android, Search, Gmail, and now Siri through the Apple deal, reaching 2 billion phones globally.

This isn't competition in the classic sense. It's division of territory: consumers get what their phones ship with (increasingly Google); startups use OpenAI because it's cheap and accessible; enterprises lock into Anthropic because they care about security.

**Here's the implication for us:** The winners in 2026 won't be building better AI models. They'll be building better applications *on top* of these models. Workflow automation. Industry-specific solutions. Integrations nobody else has thought of.

You don't compete with OpenAI by building ChatGPT 2.0. You compete by using ChatGPT in a way nobody else is thinking of.

## Sam Altman's Neural Interface Bet: Who Writes the Rules?

OpenAI's founder just committed $250 million to Merge Labs, a company building the technical standards for direct brain-AI integration.

The optimistic framing: In 10 years, your thoughts flow directly into AI without the friction of screens and keyboards. Your AI understands context at the neurological level.

The darker reality: Whoever writes the standard for neural interfaces gets godlike power over human cognition. And Sam Altman is betting that should be him.

Here's my take: This technology is coming—Elon Musk has been talking about it for years. The real question isn't whether it happens, but *who gets to write the rules.* 

"You can expand that across all kinds of sectors of the economy," I said on the broadcast. "The infrastructure layer that makes brain-AI integration seamless is also the thing that gives whoever controls it godlike power."

For us, this matters because the people building Merge Labs are the same people building the future of human-AI interaction. If we have smart operators interested in frontier technology, we should be talking to them now. Not later.

## Google's Universal Commerce Protocol: Democratization or New Walled Garden?

Google just made agentic shopping infrastructure available to all retailers, not just Amazon.

Small retailers can now plug their inventory into Google's universal commerce protocol (UCP). A shopper says "I need a durable rug under $500," and an AI agent instantly compares prices across Target, Wayfair, Walmart, Etsy. The best match wins.

**The optimistic take:** This levels the playing field. Small retailers get visibility to high-intent shoppers. Lowe's, Michaels, Poshmark, Reebok are already live. No more Amazon-only gatekeeping.

**The darker reality:** Google still controls the surfaces where this happens (search, Gemini), the payment layer, and the data. When a retailer plugs into UCP, they're giving Google visibility into their entire inventory, customer behavior, and pricing. Google's "Direct Offers" pilot means Google decides which deals show up and which retailers get visibility.

**My actual take:** Both things are true. But here's what people aren't talking about: Agentic shopping means humans stop making decisions about what to buy. AI decides based on price, availability, and data Google has about you. Retailers stop competing on brand, story, and culture. They compete on algorithm.

For small business owners here in the Coachella Valley who've built something with soul—this is how you might get replaced by an API.

Last year, I trained Palm Springs entrepreneurs on how to get surfaced and cited in AI-powered search—not just in traditional blog posts, but as direct matches to user intent. That training is becoming urgent now. Not theoretical. Urgent.

## The Data Center Coming to Imperial County: What Nobody's Talking About

Here's the story that concerns me most.

A $10 billion, 330-megawatt AI data center is being built 15 minutes from Coachella in unincorporated Imperial County.

**The scale:** 950,000 square feet. 862 megawatt battery storage. 220 Tesla megapacks. 132 Caterpillar natural gas generators. A dedicated electrical substation.

**The problem:** Imperial Irrigation District, which provides power to the region, said in their own system impact study: "We do not have the capability to reliably support this load with existing resources."

One data center uses roughly 330,000 gallons of water per day in a region already stressed by Colorado River water limits. The facility consumes nearly 30% of IID's entire available energy supply.

For context: IID says one megawatt powers roughly 1,000 homes. This data center is the equivalent of powering 330,000 homes—out of a regional population of roughly 400,000.

**The process:** Imperial County approved it quietly. The City of Imperial sued to stop it. Most valley residents still don't know it's happening.

**Why this matters:** IID just confirmed this is the beginning. They've received multiple data center inquiries ranging from 30 megawatts to 1 gigawatt per site. One gigawatt. Multiple sites means more are coming.

This isn't hypothetical. On the East Coast, governors in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Virginia are holding emergency meetings about AI data centers driving up electricity costs—because Microsoft committed to subsidizing residential rates where they build. (Translation: The base reality is rates go up; the subsidy is temporary and limited.)

---

## What We Need to Do Right Now

The real story isn't whether a data center is coming. It's whether we're going to have a voice in how it happens.

If we wait until county approval, we're too late. If we wait until construction starts, we're too late.

Our city council needs to be asking five questions *right now*:

1. Are you in conversations with developers about data center projects?
2. What's the actual plan for water, power, and grid upgrades?
3. Who decides if we're "water positive" or "water negative"?
4. Who pays for the grid upgrades when IID can't meet the load?
5. Will residents be informed *before* or after the decision?

I've been documenting this template: Major infrastructure decisions are being made in closed rooms with environmental exemptions, then announced after approval. That doesn't have to be how our region operates.

## The Grammy's Rule on AI Music: Meaningful Human Authorship (For Now)

The Recording Academy just updated its rules. AI-generated music can be nominated—but only if it has "meaningful human authorship." Pure AI, zero human input: ineligible.

**The optimistic framing:** This protects human musicians while allowing innovation. A producer using AI in their workflow, then editing, performing, and releasing it—that's art. An AI generating a song with no human input—that's data.

**The pushback:** In 10 years, this distinction will be meaningless. AI will be so integrated into music production that separating "AI music" from "human music" will be like separating digital from analog.

**My actual position:** The music industry watched what happened to photography and graphic design when AI got good. They're trying to avoid that collapse by drawing a line. I don't think it will hold: "I already see kids responding to AI-generated music and AI-generated images and video as entertainment, as content, as news, with no questioning whether a human had a hand in it at all."

For SunshineFM specifically, this matters because we're an experiment in AI-native production. Apart from my voice (maybe an hour a day), the rest of the programming is AI-generated. We're a proving ground for what AI-native media looks like.

Transparency matters more than gatekeeping. Prove the human was in there making choices. That's fair. And it's how creators stay relevant in an AI-native world.

## The Larger Pattern

All of this points to the same dynamic:

**Control of the infrastructure layer beats control of the consumer app.**

OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic aren't competing to make you a better chatbot. They're competing to write the standards that everything else runs on. Sam Altman isn't building a neural implant so you think faster. He's betting that whoever writes the standard owns the future of human cognition. Google isn't democratizing commerce—they're deepening their control of the surfaces where commerce happens.

The winners in this era will be people who understand infrastructure, incentives, and who controls the rules.

Because the rules are being written right now. And most people aren't paying attention.
