Hey,

This is Sat. Just wrapped the show and I'm sitting here with a glass of wine thinking about something that really got under my skin today.

## The Math Isn't Adding Up

You know what really hit me while I was on air? This whole conversation about productivity being flat for 50 years while birth rates drop. I kept coming back to it because it explains why everything feels so damn hard right now. We've got fewer people doing the same amount of work at the same efficiency level - no wonder everyone's exhausted.

But here's what I didn't say on air: I think most people are still sleepwalking through this transition. I've been beating this drum for three years in the valley, running workshops, doing presentations, and I swear half the audience is still waiting for someone else to figure it out for them.

## Stop Defending Your Title

That Scott Adams talent stack thing really resonated today. Not because it's revolutionary - it's not - but because it's so obvious and yet everyone's doing the opposite. I watch people clinging to their job descriptions like life rafts while the whole ship is transforming around them.

The brutal truth? If you're spending 2026 defending your old tasks instead of building new combinations, you're already behind. And I'm not talking about some distant future - I'm talking about right now. The gap between people who get this and people who don't is becoming a canyon.

## My Own Experiment

Look, Sunshine FM is my own little laboratory for this stuff. One human with AI superpowers trying to build something that would normally take a whole team. Some days it works, some days I fall on my face. But at least I'm not sitting around waiting for permission.

The music we're putting out? It's getting better faster than I expected. Not because AI is magic, but because I can iterate and experiment without worrying about studio time or label politics. That's the real power - speed of learning.

## The Local Reality Check

What's frustrating is watching our local institutions move at valley speed - which is to say, glacially. Three years I've been having these conversations with chambers and councils, and they're still forming committees to discuss forming committees.

So I said screw it. Instead of chasing them, I'm just going to build in public and let people see what's possible. Sometimes the best argument is a working example.

## The Question Nobody's Asking

Here's what keeps me up at night: everyone's asking "will AI take my job?" But nobody's asking "what could I build if I had AI as a partner?" 

Your job is just a container full of tasks. Some of those tasks are about to get really cheap to do. The question is whether you're going to focus on defending the container or figuring out what new value you can create.

Because here's the thing - capitalism rewards rarity. And the combination of human judgment with AI execution? That's about to become very rare and very valuable.

The future belongs to the stackers, not the specialists.

Talk soon,
Sat
