Oh yes. Oh, yes. Oh yes. Friday, February 6, 2026 that was just two examples of what the kinds of music that Sunshine FM records is coming out with. The first one doing just fine. One of my favorites right now. And then the second one we were writing for the Palm Springs Air Museum. And you can tell? Well, I shouldn't say you could tell. I'm going to ask you a question. You could kind of imagine that song being played in local radio stations, right? Come on, be real with me. It sounded like the music I'm hearing on some of the oldest stations in town. Again, what's happening here? Oh my God. Let me tell you. This is sat. I'm the radio station manager for Sunshine fm, Modern Media for Palm Springs Coachella, where all of this is an AI experiment. Building in public, learning in public, falling down on public, having some successes with you listening live. It's basically me, a human with an army of AI superpowers, agentic workflows, agents, foundational models, LLMs, all these things that might be new to you, they might be foreign to you, or they might be the second language that you've been learning over the last year or so. And the experiment is to see if humans actually not to see how humans and AI are going to have to learn to work together as we shift dramatically into this new era of AI. Well, who am I? Well, I'm the founder of Sunshine fm Modern Media. I've always had a lifelong dream to own a radio station. I can't afford a radio station. And by the way, at the end of the day, let's be clear about a couple of things. This is not a polished podcast. I love my podcast. I must subscribe to a hundred podcasts and only have time for X amount. Right? This is not Prof. I should say a professionally run radio station like we have in town. Lots of great radio stations. All of them have the equipment, all have, all of them have the on air personalities, they all have their program managers, the tech people, the ad sales people. Don't forget that. The ad sales people, the. That's what keeps the station alive. And the lawyers and legals and licenses, etc. Etc. Etc. I just didn't want to deal with that aspect of running a radio station. However, with the advent of GPTs about three years ago, I basically dusted off my old business plan of a radio station. Community owned, community driven, locally focused radio station. I dusted off that old business plan and that pitch deck and I went, hey, AI, how could we do this together? Well, you're listening to it Sunshine fm, Modern Media for Palm Springs, Coachella. I currently have about seven different AI artists under the Sunshine FM record label. And we are going to experiment and do a bunch of things on Sunshine FM. The rest during 2026, just to kind of hopefully expand together our knowledge on how we can utilize AI. Obviously, I'm just using it for Modern Media. You can think about this for your own business, your own company, your own startups, your own ideas. I will basically bring to you, I will interrupt this wonderful AI music, which, by the way, 24 7, it's the only radio station in town, might be the only radio station in Southern California who knows that has 247 AI generated artists and albums. And I kind of. I kind of hesitate hesitated there because I'm trying to get away from some of the labels we've given to music these days, such as Playlist. I'm not a big fan of playlists. Spotify, YouTube, Apple Music. You meant you can pick your poison of choice there. It's kind of crept into radio production. You know, they call it Playlist, maybe they call it Playlist along. I don't know. I want to go back to tracks and albums. I think we're going to be the only radio station in town that's playing full albums and if not full albums, maybe three or four songs by the same artist. Did you know that the record labels currently and the owners of the IP don't necessarily allow you to play three or four songs in a row from the same album or from the same artist? At least not on licensed radio airwaves, on the Internet, where everything goes and where Sunshine FM lives. It's an experiment. So what I'm going to do, I'm going to interrupt some of this music and I'm going to bring to you the latest in AI news, updates, features, releases from the foundational models like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Gemini. Oh, that's right, Grok. We're going to think about Grok. Too deep. Seek perplexity. All the cursor, all the players that we know about in AI Replit. Lovable Bolt. Should I go on? Yes, please go on. 11 Labs Udio Mid Journey Runway. I keep. I can keep on going, but at the end of the day, you know that this is the only radio station in town that you're going to be interrupted with information that is going to help you get ahead professionally or personally. Because like it or not, artificial intelligence, this current wave of AI is basically impacting every single aspect of our lives. Now I've been playing this record for three years now with the cities and the chambers and the councils, the organizations and the brands and the universities. And I will tell you, they are moving in Coachella Valley slow motion, which then led me to 2026, saying, I'm going to do things differently. And that is, instead of chasing them, I'm just going to go ahead and, and do the experiment myself publicly. So if you're listening to this, thank you so much for listening. You always have an open invitation. If you're playing around with the AI, if you're experimenting with AI music, if you got something to say about it, this is that space where you can get on air and let's have a conversation about it. I know there's a promise of AI. Also know the perils of AI if you listen to my TEDx talk. That's right, Sat. I'm a TEDx speaker and I spoke about AI last year and, and it was all about where I thought the future. Well, where I still think the future is taking us. And I know that there's both. I'm conflicted with both the promise of AI and the peril most of the time. Most folks I speak to locally anyway, they're a little hesitant. My network of tech startup founders in Silicon Valley and my Hollywood creative partners in Los Angeles last year and this year, they've come around to saying, how do we, how do we make the most of this not just for ourselves and our companies, but for our neighborhoods and our communities? That's what I'm about. That's why you have no advertising on this station right now. Why? Because I'm doing this as a passion project and a learning project. And I want you to tune in to a radio station that is not only entertaining because of the music, but also because you have a say in the direction of the radio station. But just as importantly, you get information, education, training on the fly. And you never know when one of these stories is going to spark an idea and you're going to say, I want to double click on that and figure out what I need to do in my professional career, because I know AI is coming. Well, actually, AI is already here. Just. Just so you know. Okay. AI is already here. You are listening to Sunshine fm, Modern media for Palm Springs Coachella. You tell them Sunshine fm. Nice one. Very good. Yeah. Interstitial. That's one of my artists, Emmy. Okay, so here's my thinking about why the math may have stopped working. If you've been feeling like the economy is a treadmill that keeps Getting faster while you stay in the same place. You are not imagining it. For 50 years, real productivity, the actual kind of juice oomph of our economy, has been flat and at the same time birth rates have been dropping. So what does that mean? That means there are fewer workers and those workers aren't getting more efficient generally. And so the math is fundamentally broken. But then three years ago, this current crop iteration of AI arrived. I say this because I want you to, hopefully this will spark some, at least some intrigue in your brain. Right? So there's this very cool perspective from AI Breakfast. It's a fantastic little newsletter, really you should be following. Their recent analysis suggests that AI isn't here to break, break the labor market. It's here to fix the math. It's the lever we need. Just as the workforce is starting to shrink. If you, if you listen, if you've been listening all year long and if you, especially if you listen to yesterday's show, the stock market, you know, lost almost a trillion dollars in market value mostly because of the fears of AI doing away with software as a service economy. Right. If you extrapolate some of that stuff, you know, if software service startups or companies start losing business because of AI, they start not necessarily letting go of people. Even though I could argue that, well, yeah, we've lost about a million jobs due to AI since 2025. But that's, you know, that's, I'll leave that for you economists and stock market junkies. I'm neither. But I have always said that because of the promise of AI, job hiring generally will basically be flat. And this is what AI Breakfast is also talking about. And here's why I want to share with you this great little perspective. And it's what I have on my bios on LinkedIn. What I have my bios. When I talk to people about what value I bring to, to any entity and any brand. I do a ton of consulting and AI. Remind me, I had a great call just a little before we came on air with somebody about AI and innovation in the hospitality area. So I'm just writing that down because I think that would be a nice little send off into the weekend. So if you, if you know me, if you've met me, if you've talked to me, you know, I basically say I'm a jack of all trades, master of none. More often than not, it's better than a master of one. People don't know that last two lines, but that's okay. Jack of all trades, right? This perspective basically Says to win in the future, stop trying to be a specialist, which is what let's say a lot of folks have been telling you or us, and start becoming a. They call it a stacker, I call it a jack of all trades. And so we're going to do have a quick little talent stack strategy. This is what it means. The first thing we need to get right in our vocab is when you hear people say, AI is coming for my job. Think of it this way. A job is just a container, and inside that container are a bunch of tasks. So I'm going to take you back 30, 40, 50 years. Right? Executives used to dictate letters to secretaries. Wow, that's going Mad Men, isn't it? The secretary typed it, mailed it, and filed it. So then later on in life, when email arrived, the task of typing moved to the executive. Did the secretary disappear? No, not right away, but the secretary now called an executive assistant. They moved on to higher leverage work. Yes, I know, very simplistic kind of analogy, but that's the way I want you to think of it, right? A job is just a container. The container contains a bunch of tasks. AI right now is doing the same thing. It's unbundling your day. It takes the research, the formatting, the basic coding, and the busy work. What I want you to do is take a look at your to do list from yesterday. If you stripped away every task that a smart machine could do in 10 seconds, what's left? That remainder. That's you. The. That's your actual value, and are you spending enough time on it now? I say this because I have this conversation all the time. We ran close to 20 workshops at Cal State last year. I also did another 10 or dozen presentations and boot camps at various chambers and associations and organizations. And one of the things I was trying to get across was breaking down your work process or your to do list. And what simple little piece, what task could AI take off of your plate? We were doing that a year ago. And I'm not sure if people have really got that message. It sure doesn't feel like they have. But anyway, that's how I want you to think about this. Okay? So the goal for you is to try and become irreplaceable. And the way you do that with this current crop of AI is creating a talent stack. Now, the talent stack concept was popularized by Scott Adams, who was the creator of Dilbert the cartoon. He argued that trying to be the best in the world at one thing is a losing game. You Know how your parents said you're going to be the best, you can do anything you put your mind to, you can be president, etc. Etc. Well, he says trying to be the best in the world at the one thing is a losing game. The odds of you being an Olympic athlete or a Nobel Prize winning coder are microscopic. But being in the top 25% of three different things, that that's achievable. He knew that he wasn't the best artist, he knew he wasn't the funniest writer, and he knew he wasn't the smartest businessman, but he was pretty good at all three. So when you stack funny plus drawing plus business knowledge, you get some aspect of success. AI is basically doing the same thing. It's just collapsed the cost of building your stack because now you can be a pretty good writer, a pretty good coder, and a pretty good designer all at once because AI is acting as the bridge. I could go so much deeper into this because I've been battling with this all year long in trying to build Sunshine fm. But I'll come back to that some other time. So the question I have for you is this. If you could pick two skills outside of your current title to add to your stack, what would they be? What would happen if you combined your current expertise with, let's say, I don't know, data analysis or economic research? And here's the truth. AI does not flatten the playing field, it magnifies it. And what we mean by that is why we created aicv, which is AI Coachella Valley, our in person events and training venture. The gap between good and great is about to become a canyon. If you use AI to just do your job, you'll be fine for a while. I see this firsthand because I've been having this conversation for three years. Locally, people are still fine, but here's what we're going into for 2026 and beyond. If you use AI to orchestrate or to build your one person empire, hello Sunshine FM. Where you handle the strategy and the AI handles the execution, you have an opportunity to become something rare. And capitalism rewards rarity. The future does not belong to the person defending a title. It belongs to the person building that combination. So here we go. Final question for you. Are you spending your time defending your old tasks? Well, by the way, I could go into that too. Come on, I'll say that again. Are you spending your time defending. Oh, there we go. How about that? Are you spending your time defending your line? Maybe I'm trying to create a song out of this? Or are you busy stacking new skills? Because the math of the future only works if you're willing to move? Are you spending your time defending your title? Are you spending your time defending your salary? Are you spending your time defending your job? Are you spending your time defending your place in that company? Or in the council, or in the university, or in the organization? If that's what you're doing, you'll be fine for a while. AI is coming to disrupt every aspect of our lives. DM me. You have my email. Go to Sunshine fm. DM me. Many questions or comments about what I just said. The Talent Stack Revolution. It's here. I know this first hand because I tried for the last two years to move folks to think new business models. That's why 2026 is this sunshine FM modern media for Palm Springs Coachella. Experiment in a live radio. Well, let's just experiment generally. Okay, so the Vibe Working Revolution. So knowing what we've built last year in the workshops with aicv, knowing this kind of thought process of talent stacking that I just shared with you, which by the way, just hit the hit my radar just this week from AI Breakfast, I thought I'd let you know two things. One, where we're going with our workshops and boot camps in 2026, and it's called the Vibe Working Revolution. Why is this timely? Well, number one, you may have heard of the term Vibe coding. Just to give an idea what that is, it basically says it's the idea that you don't need to know Python or C anymore. You just describe the vibe of the app you want or the website you want, or the workflow you want, and AI builds it. We've been talking about Vibe Coding for over a year in our workshops. But what happened in the last 24 hours was that the goalpost just moved. And what I mean by that is this. The executives from Microsoft and Anthropic, they're declaring a brand new phase. They're calling it Vibe Working. And if we Vibe and if Vibe Coding changed how we build apps and websites, Vibe Working is about to change how we do everything else. So what is it? Anthropic's head of product, Scott White, explained to CNBC on Wednesday. He says that we're moving from chatting with a bot to. To delegating to an agent. Vibe Coding was for the builders. Hello. Vibe Working is for the knowledge workers, the lawyers, the accountants and the analysts. So he's suggesting instead of asking an AI to write an email, you Hand it a workflow and you say review these 20 contracts, flag the tax risks and update our internal spreadsheet. Spreadsheet. Then you walk away. The AI executes the task end to end with almost zero oversight. And the timing here is not an accident because this week saw a massive clash of the Titans in the AI space. We talked yesterday how Anthropic released Claude Opus 4.6. I haven't updated my Claude to have 4.6, but the folks that I listen to about 4.6, they say it's a beast. It features agent teams which is basically what we're trying to build for this actually is what we're trying to build to build the radio station that coordinate on complex projects with a 1 million token memory. Right now they're token limit on 4.5 is 200k. I know this firsthand because I ran into the limit this morning building some workflows for the station and I ran out of tokens. Now I had to pay for extra usage, but I know that the limit is 200k. 4.6 increases that token memory to 1 million. That means it can read an entire library of your company's data without breaking a sweat. And then literally when they came out with this yesterday, a few minutes later, OpenAI, the makers of ChatGPT, they fired back by unveiling ChatGPT 5.3 Codex, which they call a full spectrum professional work. It's designed to handle your slides, your spreadsheets, your research all at once. And Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleiman said the barrier to entry has officially gone. He says you can basically watch a three minute video and start Vibe working immediately. So what happened while the tech CEO was were coming out with this on CNBC and Bloomberg and they released these great models, the stock market all week long and yesterday even more stock. So panicked. When Anthropic showed how its new Claude cowork assistant could automate legal research and contract review, the industry's old guard took a hit. Thomson Reuters, the giant of legal and financial data, saw its stock plunge 18%, the largest single day loss in the company's history. The message from investors was clear. If a, if an AI can vibe its way through a legal brief, what happens to the companies that charge thousands for that same data? Again, it sounds like I'm repeating from yesterday. I'm not. I'm just basically connecting the dots from the stock market to the jobs reports and what AI giants like Anthropic with Claude and Open Air with Chat, GPT and Microsoft, they were coming out and saying, and if you ever want to know, if it's a sign of the future, just follow the money. I can't even keep up with how many trillions of dollars are being invested in AI startups and data centers and compute. And I'm not saying it's great. Again, promise and peril, a lot of promise. I left you yesterday with a great little promise for AI detects Alzheimer's and dementia earlier than humans can. That's the promise and the peril. Everything else that you're fearful of is the peril. So from talent stacking to vibe working, Talk about some industry. The, the AI and the publishing industry, which I'm a part of. I'm a modern media company, so media publishing falls underneath that. I'm a record producer, so publishing falls into that. This is more going to be about the content and generally delivered digital or even magazines or even papers. Actually, actually, you know, I think I love magazines, actually. I like the zine culture from back in the day. And if Sunshine FM slowly starts moving the needle, I don't know, maybe Sunshine, we'll have a Sunshine FM local zine as well. Okay, so imagine building a house only for someone else to move in, change the locks and start charging rent. That was a. That was a visual that I ab, which is the Interactive Advertising Bureau, and their CEO David Cohen said in a in their annual conference here in Palm Desert held in JW Marriott, he dropped a bomb in the AI industry. He basically says it's not innovation, it's called stealing. Those are fighting words. And I know many people locally who would take that stance as well. I'm not here judge. I'm here to say that's what David Cohen says. A ton of people also agree with him. He says AI companies are free riding on the backs of publishers. And when you think about it, every news article, every recipe, every local report you read online, well, AI models like Chat GPT and Claude and Perplexity and Google Gemini, they use that data to learn. And are they really paying the people who actually wrote it? That's been a conversation we've been having for many, many, actually a couple of decades. But now that AI has come along and basically can scrape the entire Internet without asking, are the people who actually create this content being fairly compensated? So what did the CEO of the IAB come out with? His solution was, I'm putting this in quotes, the Accountability for Publishers Act. It's a proposed law that would force the tech giants to pay up. He's already shopping it. Shopping it or lobbying I think those in this world, it's either or. He's already shopping it to two US Senators. His message is simple. No publishers, no content. No content, no Internet. That is powerful, David. And it's not just about AI. Cohen says we are moving into the agentic world. This whole decade we've been talking about cookies and privacy. This year we're talking about AI agents doing the shopping for us. Well, we were talking about this last year in our workshops. We, we did say that agent to agent commerce was here. And then ChatGPT and Google Gemini were going all in on agentic commerce. The fact that it's released now in January 2026 makes it more real. I have a bunch of stories about that too, but we won't have time for it today. Cohen is worried that the connective tissue between you, your digital bot, meaning he's pushing for new standards in how we measure ads on ctv. That's connected tv because right now it's a mess of different sizes and rules. Okay, he just got into a whole bunch of publishing geek speak there and stuff. Bottom line, he has to do what's best for his members is and protect what ground they still have and what, what that means, what monetization revenue they can still get. Don't blame him on Bitcoin. I don't have the answer either. Right now. You and I as consumers. Yes. Are we, are we benefiting from getting this free content? Sure we are. You know we can. Unfortunately we're used to paying. Actually we're used to paying zero for all this content. Right. I've seen you, I've seen you skip from one app to another when you can't get the answer you're looking from because of a paywall or a subscription. I see you people on Netflix sharing your passwords. Anyway, it is a mess of different sizes and rules. I really don't know what's going to happen when content creators are not fairly compensated for their work. I think what that what I've been seeing for the last, it's been about a decade anyway since the slow decay of media. This is just another tectonic shift that's going to make publishing and media either try and hold on to their. Current ip, such as New York Times is doing with their lawsuits, which, you know, in honesty, I hope they win. I mean, keep in mind the big AI foundational models did. They've already been found guilty, scraping the entire Internet and a lot of it without permission. But you and I as consumers, we have to be thinking about, yeah, we're voting with our wallets and our thumbs as it were. But you know when it comes for what kind of work you're creating, actually the kind of content you're creating, it may not be influencer content, but even the work you're doing is value to somebody. And when that value gets stripped away by the AI agents, yes, it's something for you to take seriously in terms of what's happening with content creators right now. IAB is looking to say the free ride is over. I think the jury is out on that one. I'm not so sure. I gave all you iOS and iPhone owners out there little bit of good. Actually no, I gave you a little bit of a tease yesterday, didn't I? I said, hey, stop making fun of us Google Android phone users because for the last two years Apple has been sucking at AI. Well they've been catching up now purely because they made a deal with Google and Google is going to be basically going to be the AI behind a whole bunch of Apple products. Most, most likely Siri. So if you're not being happy with Siri up to this point, it might actually get better now that Google's involved. Okay, I did leave you yesterday by saying I'm going to give you a couple of pieces of news that Apple has come out with and the one I want to talk about is it seems like Apple is slowly opening up the doors of his walled garden and for the first time ever they are allowing third party AI assistants like ChatGPT to take over CarPlay. And for those who are not Apple users and if you're a Google Android person like me, CarPlay is basically their Android auto in the car. You now have to hook up Android auto to get your maps and your whatever texts etc etc in your playlist. Oh my goodness. CarPlay is the apple version of this. So just imagine this. OpenAI ChatGPT, Google's Gemini and Anthropics. Claude, you, you hear me mention those three all the time. They've all been given permission to go ahead and create tools and apps and services and integrations with CarPlay. So soon you'll be asking for directions and you'll be having full on hands free conversations with not Siri but the smartest AI agents out there on the planet. So why is this the big deal? Apple never shares? Siri has been the only voice in the car and as I mentioned before, Siri is not keeping up with the rest of the AI assistants. And while they're delaying the overhaul of Siri until The spring of 2026 around Coachella was probably maybe around my birthday in May, maybe around June when the Palm Springs AI Tech and Creativity Expo is meant to happen again in, at the convention center in Palm Spring. So you know, jot that down and. But the customers are not, they're kind of restless. They've been telling Apple executives for quite some time, Siri sucks man. I don't want to wait. So Apple is allowing the bots to come into their phones, at least not on the iPhone but in CarPlay. Now Apple hasn't necessarily given up entirely because one of the things that they are working on is their own secret project codenamed Campos C A M P O S Campos. Keep an eye on that one. Plus they have an answer engine that they're calling Knowledge. Do you know what the Knowledge is in London? It's this test that you have to pass if you want to be a taxi driver. Not an Uber driver, a real taxi driver, you know, London cabbie. You have to have the Knowledge which is basically every back street, every main street, every side street in London and you have to know how to avoid one way areas. Stop signs over there, yield signs mostly we don't have stop signs. Specific. Precisely. And then every light and every bus lane. You have to know everything about London streets. That's called the Knowledge. And Apple's realized they can't win this alone and so they're partnered with Apple. As I mentioned to you, opening up CarPlay basically admits that hey, for these complex tasks we just can't do it. So let let ChatGPT or Google Gemini do it. So if you're an iPhone user and you've been waiting for this, congratulations. If you're an iPhone user and you want to talk about this because, well, you've got an opinion about this, reach out Sunshine fm, get a hold of me. Let's get you on the air and let's chit chat about where Apple may have dropped the ball when it comes to AI. Oh that's a cool. That's right. I was just looking at my songs that I've got. Not queued up but all over the place. I'm going to play one of these later when we, when we exit. But before we do, let's talk about real estate again. Remember yesterday, was he hasting? No, it's two days ago. I told you there's a stealth startup that is turning you. Which by the way one of my favorite real estate plays right now. And the story I'm going to share with you is not as exciting but it's kind of exciting. The, the story I meant to. I shared with you a couple of days ago about this startup that's using AI to turn you from a. A real estate buyer to possibly a property developer on the fly was pretty brilliant and I cannot wait to get my hands on their services. I think it'll be pretty interesting. Another real estate piece of news with AI is right now, when you're using, you know, when you're going on Redfin or Zillow or any of your favorite real estate tools, you're basically, you know, you're scrolling through wonderful photos or maybe not so wonderful, depending on clicking checkboxes. The same old way. We've been using mobile phones for a long time, right? Scrolling, scrolling, checking checkboxes, hitting, hitting links. Well, we mentioned to you that last year Chat GPT was going to open up agentic commerce and agent to agent commerce. One of the most valuable pieces of real estate is going to be Chat GPT homepage, as it were. Just like Google Gemini homepage and maybe not Claude so much because that's mostly for developers and enterprises. But possibly soon Redfin and Zumper officially moved into Chat GPT. Redfin just launched the AI app today and Zumper beat them to the punch by just a few hours. And the way it works is this. The way you used to search is you set a price, you'd click three bedrooms. You'd hope the map didn't glitch. Those days are over. Why? Because now you can just talk to your bot. You tell the bot, hey, find me a place with a backyard, a short commute to downtown, and enough room for a home office. That's the power that Redfin and Zumper are promising by being on the homepage of ChatGPT when you as a consumer are asking questions when you're house hunting. Redfin's senior veep of product, Ariel Dos Santos, says this is about making search conversational rather than mechanical. Okay, let me quickly pause there. Conversational, really? Let me tell you, 2015, I was a part of several tech startups. I was on the board of advisors of a variety of them. I started my own tech startups that was all around conversational commerce. We absolutely believed back then, 2015, 2016, 2017, that the future of the Internet was going to be voice. What you're hearing right now, that was going to be the future of the Internet. We came up with so many great startups back then, developing skills for Alexa and camera with the term for it right now, maybe projects for Google Assistant and even for Siri Spent, you know, there was a few million going down that startup road. And one of the things was you talking to your car. Remember this is before Android Auto or CarPlay was really fully integrated with all the car systems. You talk to you, your car while you're driving, it would answer your emails, they would place the order for food by the time you got home, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. It was all conversational commerce. So it's interesting right now that 11 years later, this executive is talking about conversational rather than mechanical. Well, we knew this is the way it was going to go. So all good, but it's part of a massive wave because we're talking about an ecosystem of 800 million weekly active users. That's what Chat GPT has, by the way. And if you were in our workshops last year, you, you heard us say you have a small window of opportunity as a small startup or a small business in Coachella Valley. You can fight against the big boys. Here's one way of doing it. Get on the front page of Chat GPT. Easier said than done for sure now, but a year ago I think it was was easier than it is now. We still have this, we still have the thesis of how it should be done now and where the puck is going to. And so if you're interested in getting your, your business, your startup on the front pages of the LLMs, Reach Out, Sunshine FM, we've got some of the answers. And here's the thing. This, this new technology is not just for buyers. Zumper is targeting the renters. They believe they're the first rental only platform in the Chat GPT store. Did you know Chat GPT actually had a store? I bet you you didn't. And here's the cool thing, people are actually using it. This is not just an idea, right? Zumper's data shows the number of renters using AI tools more than doubled in the last year from about 5% to about 10%. Oh, that's nice. And at the end of the day, this isn't just a gimmick. It's what we talked about all last year and maybe even the year before in our workshops and our boot camps and our consultations. It's a land grab right now since OpenAI has opened its app store late last year, but they promised it earlier in 2025. The race is on to see who becomes the default door for various sectors, various domains. In this case, the race is on to becomes who becomes a default door for real. Estate. Redfin is leaning on the idea that they want to be the everything app for your mortgage and your move. And I think they are also seeing that where the puck is going is where we consumers may not automatically go to Google, may not automatically go to Zillow, may or may not automatically go to the Interwebs. We may just be talking to our phones, to our cars. And when you're at that moment of asking a question, ChatGPT or Google, Gemini or Claude Code or Perplexity or Xai, they are going to be on the other end having a conversation with you and suggesting to you the brands, the companies that you may want to consider doing business with. If you're a real estate agent in town, a broker, anybody in commercial real estate, and you want to know how to utilize some of this wonderful technology and how to get on the front pages, Reach out. Sunshine FM AICV has a couple of boot camps coming up this year. They'll help you beyond the basics. By the way, talking about that, there was a basic. When I say that, because I saw the curriculum and I saw the sales literature from an outside consultant, you know, basically LA based, most probably coming into the Coachella Valley and turning heads from the leaderships in all these organizations and city councils across the valley with AI this and AI that, which by the way, they're not wrong in what they were selling. It just kind of burns me every time our leaders go outside of the Valley because they don't believe they have talent locally. And I'm here to say, yeah, you do. Because what those guys are teaching you and selling you for fifteen hundred dollars a person, it's going to be outdated in six months. And then what are you going to do? That's okay. You know what you're going to do? AICV is going to say, hey, post your training that you just spent 1500 bucks a person on, we're happy to show you what you go next level. And next level, well, it's vibe coding, it's Claude cowork, it's Claude Code, it's cursor, it might be open claw this, but all these things are not stuff that people are teaching you right now locally. But AICV is happy to take you from what you've learned with these other consultants and up your game if you're interested. Sunshine fm, get ahold of us. And then finally, I told you I'm going to talk to you about AI innovation and hospitality. I was recruited this morning. It's early days, okay? I'm not going to get the position because it's a pretty big company. They have a thousand properties under their management. They're the first hospitality company I have seen with a title because they know they need this with the title Vice President of AI Innovation. Magic word is innovation. If you've come to our workshops, you'll know I constantly go on and on about there's only three ways AI is going to take you to the next level. Actually, there's only three ways you're going to use AI. Two of them are going to help you now. One of them is going to keep you around for the future. You can use AI to curtail expenses. You can read into that whatever you want, however you think. Cutting expenses, that's one way of using AI. The second one is using AI to get more revenue, whatever that means for you, using AI to get more monetization. And the third, the one that's barely uttered, barely used, is how can you use AI to totally disrupt yourself, totally change your business models the way that your industry does, does things. And ladies and gentlemen, you know what we call that? We call that innovation. So when I was speaking to the headhunter this morning and she told me they are looking for somebody with real world hospitality experience along with real world tech and AI understanding and there's very few of those people around, there's this new job at a huge hospitality management firm and the title that I'm so excited about is VP of AI Innovation. If you're not innovating, I'm going to say you're flat lining. For the next few years, AI is your opportunity to start thinking differently about how you do your work and how you treat your employees and how you treat your customers. Because AI can benefit everybody in your ecosystem if used. Well, have a fantastic weekend. We'll see you again after the super bowl on Monday. Reach out to me if you've got any questions. You want to get on the show Sunshine fm.
