Hey,

This is Sat. Just cracked open a second glass of wine and honestly, my brain is still buzzing from today's show.

## The Humanities Are Having Their Moment

You know what really got me thinking tonight? That quote from Daniela Amodei at Anthropic - the one about how studying humanities will become more crucial than ever. I've been saying this in workshops for months, and here's the co-founder of one of the biggest AI companies basically validating what I've been preaching to half-empty rooms.

She said they prioritize hiring people who are "kind, compassionate and curious with a desire to assist others" over pure tech backgrounds. Christ, finally someone gets it. All those humanities majors who've been getting shit for the past twenty years? Their time is coming.

My kids are watching this unfold, and I genuinely hope this is the world they inherit. Not some dystopian tech hellscape, but a place where being genuinely human - emotionally intelligent, curious, actually giving a damn about other people - becomes the competitive advantage.

## Spotify's Getting Greedy (Again)

Speaking of things that irritate me - Spotify's already built the tech for AI remixes and covers, they're just waiting for the music industry to sort out licensing. How convenient. 

Look, I love the idea of AI remixes. Hell, we're doing AI-generated music 24/7 here at Sunshine FM. But let's be real about what this means. The top 1% of artists get another revenue stream, another brick in their wall, while the 99% fight for scraps. It's the same old story.

If you're a local band making 60 bucks off 10,000 streams, this isn't going to change your life. You're still making your living off live shows and merch. But hey, if you're creating AI music here in the valley, hit me up. We're the only station playing this stuff, and I want to hear what you're making.

## The Shopping Bot Revolution Nobody Asked For

Here's something wild - apparently 60-70% of mobile shoppers are willing to try AI shopping assistants, but 70% of them bail because the recommendations suck. Classic, right?

But here's the kicker: Target is seeing 40% monthly growth in traffic from ChatGPT. Amazon's got this chatbot called Rufus (did you even know that existed?) with 300 million users, and people who use it are 60% more likely to buy something.

The really crazy part? Half of consumers say they'd let AI handle the entire shopping process, including payment. Agent-to-agent commerce isn't coming - it's here. We called this last year.

The problem is trust. One bad experience and people walk away. But the numbers don't lie - we went from 12% to 35% of U.S. shoppers using AI assistance in one year.

## What Actually Matters

Sitting here with friends, reflecting on all this noise - what strikes me is how fast everything is moving, but how little of it actually serves regular people. A billion referral visits to major websites sounds impressive until you realize it's the same big players getting bigger.

If you're a small business in the valley trying to figure out AI customer service, don't get caught up in the hype. Focus on solving real problems for real people. And if you need help thinking through the strategy, not just the tech, you know where to find me.

Talk soon,
