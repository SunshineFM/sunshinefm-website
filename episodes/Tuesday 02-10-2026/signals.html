  "articleBody": "Anthropic AI co-founder Daniela Amodei told ABC News that studying the humanities will become more crucial than ever as artificial intelligence transforms the workforce, arguing that uniquely human qualities like emotional intelligence and communication will gain value rather than diminishing. According to the broadcast, Amodei stated that \"the things that make us human will become much more important instead of much less important,\" and revealed that Anthropic prioritizes hiring individuals who are \"exceptional communicators, possess high emotional intelligence, and are kind, compassionate and curious with a desire to assist others\" over those with purely technical backgrounds. Sat emphasized this contradicts 20 years of career advice pushing students away from humanities, noting \"if you are somebody who's basically going to school or have gone to school in the humanities for the last 20 years, you've been told that is not where the future is going and maybe for the last 20 years, generally they were right. But with AI and research and the ongoing disruption that these AI technologies will have on almost every segment of society, there will be this genuine need to find humans who are genuinely human.\" This represents a fundamental shift in workforce training and education strategy for the Coachella Valley. Universities and training programs should prioritize developing soft skills, emotional intelligence, and communication abilities alongside technical competencies. For job seekers and students in the region, this signals that humanities education is becoming increasingly valuable rather than obsolete in the AI era. Local businesses and startups should reconsider hiring criteria to emphasize human qualities that AI cannot replicate, potentially opening opportunities for workers previously overlooked in favor of purely technical candidates. AI platforms are now sending over a billion referral visits to major websites, with ChatGPT driving 40% monthly growth in traffic to retailers like Target. However, the broadcast revealed a critical adoption problem: \"nearly 70% of the people who use it bail because they get bad product recommendations.\" Despite this, adoption is accelerating rapidly\u2014last year only 12% of U.S. shoppers used AI assistance, but that number has jumped threefold to 35% in 2026. Even more significant, \"half of those consumers say that they'd let AI handle the entire shopping process, including payment,\" signaling readiness for agent-to-agent commerce. Sat noted that Amazon's AI chatbot Rufus, which most consumers don't even know exists, has 300 million users, and \"people who use it are 60% more likely to actually buy something.\" The broadcast emphasized that trust is fragile and \"when the experience kind of sucks, you kind of walk away and you don't really do much after one bad experience.\" Coachella Valley businesses have a critical window to get AI shopping and customer service experiences right before consumer trust erodes permanently. The massive growth from 12% to 35% adoption in one year shows rapid consumer acceptance, but the 70% abandonment rate reveals that poor implementation is worse than no implementation. Local retailers and e-commerce businesses should invest in quality AI customer service development rather than quick, cheap chatbot solutions. The emergence of agent-to-agent commerce means businesses need strategic AI foundations now, not superficial chatbot implementations. Sat specifically offered to connect local businesses with developers who can create properly designed AI customer experiences that build rather than destroy trust. A startup called Nuo raised $25 million to scale its AI receptionist platform specifically for small and medium businesses, addressing a problem Sat describes as endemic in the Coachella Valley. According to company data shared in the broadcast, \"small businesses miss about 20 to 40% of incoming calls due to staffing constraints and after hours inquiries,\" with co-founder David Yang stating that \"small businesses are under pressure to respond instantly and most still lose revenue simply because no one picks up the phone.\" The company has already built about 15,000 AI agents with 200 certified partners, with early adoption led by medical practices, chiropractors, opticians, dental offices, restaurants, and home service companies where missed calls directly translate to lost revenue. However, Sat warned against businesses rushing to implement cheap chatbot solutions, emphasizing that \"if the chatbots are a representative of you and your company, it's not something that you should take lightly. You certainly shouldn't just put one together just because you can.\" He stressed that while tools make it easy to create AI assistants, \"it is so easy to put these together, but so difficult to get that perfect experience where the person who's calling you or texting you, your customer, acquisition costs is where you're spending to get this person. You want them to have a delightful experience.\" Coachella Valley small businesses are hemorrhaging revenue through missed calls and outdated phone systems, creating an immediate opportunity for properly implemented AI receptionist solutions. Medical practices, service businesses, and restaurants in the region should prioritize this technology, but must resist the temptation to deploy cheap, poorly designed chatbots that damage customer experience. The 20-40% missed call rate represents significant lost revenue that AI can recapture, but only if implemented strategically with security, user experience, and business outcomes in mind. Local businesses should seek certified partners or professional implementation rather than DIY solutions that often result in abandonment or mediocre customer experiences that harm brand reputation. Spotify co-CEO Gustav Soderstrom told investors that the company has already built the technology to let fans create AI remixes and covers of their favorite artists' music, but is waiting on the music industry to establish a licensing framework before deploying it. Sat, who comes from the record industry, expressed concern that this development will further disadvantage independent artists, stating \"unless you're the top 1% of creators, the 99% of music creators and artists and bands are going to be fighting for scraps while all the big artists are going to go ahead and get all their remixes and remakes and additional money.\" He emphasized that the barrier to entry for independent musicians is already nearly insurmountable, saying \"it's just going to be even tougher and tougher and tougher for you to break through all that noise out there to get your signal across.\" The broadcast noted that for local bands and artists, \"you most likely make your living through live performance, merch and licensing and streaming is pretty much a very, very tiny piece of the pie. We're talking about 60 to 85 bucks for 10,000 streams and that's before everybody else takes their cuts.\" The coming AI remix economy will likely increase inequality in the music industry, making it even harder for Coachella Valley independent artists to break through. Local musicians should not count on AI remixes as a revenue stream and should instead focus on live performance, merchandise, and direct fan relationships. However, this same AI technology that Spotify controls is now available to independent creators\u2014Sat's own station creates 24/7 AI-generated music and invites local artists to use these tools to create and share their own AI-generated tracks. The opportunity for valley musicians lies in embracing AI music creation tools directly rather than waiting for major platforms to provide access through restrictive licensing frameworks."
