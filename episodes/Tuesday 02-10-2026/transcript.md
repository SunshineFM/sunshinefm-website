Another AI generated track for the coachella valley. It's called tumbleweed and it's out on sunshine fm records. You're listening to sunshine fm modern media for palm springs coachella. It. So much in the news about AI over the last weekend and what we're on February 10, Tuesday, barely started the month and there's so much to get get through basically. Good afternoon, I am Sat. I am the radio station manager, program director of Sunshine fm. Sunshine FM Modern Media for Palm Springs Coachella is an experiment in human and AI working together to create hopefully something of value. And what I've chosen to do with Sunshine FM is bring the world of AI and this bubble that I seem to be living in the news, the updates, the features, the personalities, the brands, the tools, the foundational models, everything that's happening in the world of AI and bring it home right here to Palm Springs Coachella. Small business owners, enterprise leadership class, universities, anybody that's here in the Coachella Valley. Sunshine FM is your home for AI generated music, entertainment and news. What you heard at the top of the hour was another one of our AI generated bands and artists on Sunshine FM Records. I actually looked this weekend, actually Friday, mostly about a dropship vinyl and CD versions of our bands. I didn't really want to get into those kind of physicals. I certainly don't want to be streaming. I, you know my you can get streaming anywhere and everywhere. Have fun with that. I didn't want to get into an actual physical, but I might. So drop me a note@sunshinef.fm. let me know if you'd be interested in vinyls or CDs of any one of the music artists that you hear on Sunshine fm. So much to get through. And if you've been listening since the start of the year, this is just me finding my kind of rhythm, my cadence, where I think I'm where things are working, where they're landing. I'm getting some DMs, I'm getting some emails from folks who are listening who give me some of their feedback. And so slowly building in public, experimenting on air live to try and get something that's going to bring real value to everybody here in Coachella Valley. And just a quick disclaimer. This is not a polished podcast. We all listen to hundreds of podcasts and they are great. But this is not a polished podcast. There is no editing, there is no script reading. This is mostly me looking at the news AI news of the, let's say last 24 hours or certain items that came up on my own radar. And I thought that were interesting that I want to riff on and bring home to us here in Coachella Valley. And this is certainly not a professional radio station. You have many radio stations in town you can listen to. I think what they do is fantastic for the local businesses. I want to see if Sunshine fm, with the help of AI agents and AI foundational models, can do a different version of Radio. One that I'd want to exist and apparently Mainstream doesn't have a space for. So with that said, let's quickly go into some of the things that kind of came up on my radar this week, actually for the last few days that I thought were pretty interesting. I think what I'll start off with is if you don't know the Amadis, they are the brother and sister co founders of Anthropic AI. Anthropic are the makers of Claude, one of our favorite, if not top three foundational models in the world of AI. She basically came out and said something that we've been training all last year in our workshops. She told ABC News that studying the humanities will become more crucial than ever as artificial intelligence transforms the workforce, arguing that uniquely human qualities like emotional intelligence and communication will gain value rather than diminishing her quote, the things that make us human will become much more important instead of much less important. And she said that Anthropic, the company prioritizes hiring individuals who are exceptional communicators, possess high emotional intelligence, and are kind, compassionate and curious with a desire to assist others. Others over those with purely technical backgrounds. I found this fascinating. Thank you, Daniela. I think this is brilliant. I mean, this is the world that I hope we inherit. I hope, I should say, I hope my kids inherit. This is the world that I want us to be building together. High emotional intelligence, kind, compassionate and curious with a desire to assist others. I love that. So thanks very much, Daniela. Too often I'm hearing conversations locally that what are the skills being taught and what are the skills going to be needed in the AI workforce of the future? I do think that you still need some coding capabilities. Don't be too technical, because I think the the ability of AI tools right now give us those almost not quite superpowers, but they give us enough powers to be dangerous. Just don't do it on your company's computers, okay? Do them on your own laptops. But if you are somebody who's basically going to school or have gone to school in the humanities for the last 20 years, you've been told that is not where the future is going and maybe for the last 20 years, generally they were right. But with AI and research and the ongoing disruption that these AI technologies will, will have on almost every segment of society, there will be this not recoil but this genuine need to find humans who are genuinely human. And in my world, genuinely human are folks that are curious, compassionate, desire to assist others, kind and high emotional intelligence. So thanks, Daniella. Thanks for putting it out there. You're saying something that I've been, I've been saying forever and I will continue to say because I really hope that is the world that we're going into. You're listening to Sunshine FM Modern media for Palm Springs Coachella. Spotify. I have Spotify. I imagine you do too. I come from the record industry back in the day, don't like what Spotify has done to the record industry. But what are you gonna do? Right? That's between them and YouTube Music and Apple Music. Well, they kind of own, they own the, the pipeline basically. Spotify's co CEO Gustav Soderstrom basically told investors that they've already built the technology to let fans create AI remixes and covers of their favorite artists music. The catch? They're just waiting on the music industry to figure out the licensing framework first. Okay, that's kind of rich, right? I love the idea of AI remixes and covers of our favorite artists music. I do not like the idea that's everything is going to have to go through Spotify because. Well, first of all, most music goes through Spotify and if existing situation or historical precedent can be counted on, well, unless you're the top 1% of creators, the 99% of music creators and artists and bands are going to be fighting for scraps while all the big artists are going to go ahead and get all their remixes and remakes and additional money etc, etc. Another revenue stream, another, let's put it this way, more bricks in the wall. Another brick in the wall, right. Basically the wall is getting higher, it's getting wider. If you're independent artist or if you're not one of the top 1% artists, it's just going to be even tougher and tougher and tougher for you to break through all that noise out there to get your signal across. It's already tough enough to get your music out to your fans. It's already tough enough to get new fans. Will this absolutely, you know, get you more revenue, more fans? I, I don't think so. At the end of the day, if you are a local band or artist, you most likely make your living through Life, performance, merch and licensing and streaming is pretty much a very, very tiny piece of the pie. We're talking about 60 to 85 bucks for 10,000 streams and that's before everybody else takes their cuts. So who knows? One thing I do know, I use AI to generate brand new music and I co create it, co write it, co write the lyrics, co write the arrangements, co write the concepts and the topics. Because the capability now of getting demo ready versions out there that accustomed to what I'm seeing in the Coachella Valley are pretty powerful. And so we're the only radio station in town that I know of that has 24, 7 AI generated music. And we are there for you if you are interested in that, if you're still interested, obviously, as I am too, with some of your favorite bands out there, you've got plenty of other places to go listen to once in a while. If you want to know what's happening in AI and you want to listen to some AI generated music and more importantly, if you are actually creating AI generated music because you have these superpowers now, or at least some powers, reach out to me Sunshine fm and share with me what you got. Happy to have you on air. Happy to play your music on air. That's the whole point of Sunshine fm. Modern media for palm strings, Coachella. Okay, so still talking about music, YouTube Music is rolling out an AI powered playlist generator for premium subscribers, basically allowing you to create custom playlists through text or voice prompts describing moods, genres or activities. It's basically just trying to give you more for your subscription so they can, they can retain, they can stop the churn basically is what it comes down to. Right? And what this really means is it's not necessarily giving you, I think it's giving you a mix of AI music and existing licensed music based on your prompting. Whether it's a progressive house mix for a chill party or a 90s classic hits, it generates tailored playlists and you're basically just using simple words to have a DJ play these songs for you. Now having said that, I think it's better than making a playlist. I think we all got tired of making your own playlists and if you haven't got tired, just give them, just give it time. You will get tired of making playlists. Perhaps just telling your aidj, hey, make me a playlist based on my mood. That's pretty powerful. That could work. So we'll see where it goes. I'm not sure if, I'm not sure if I'm going to be using it. I'm not the target market. But if you end up using. If you're a Premium subscriber to YouTube Music and you're using this or you've seen it, reach out to me, Sunshine fm, Sunshine fm, and let me know what you think of it, pros and cons. And I would love to share that information with the rest of our audience. You are listening, Modern media for palm springs coachella. Okay, so back in the day, I came up with this startup about 2015, 2016, called Audio Pilot. And that vision we had back then was we would have the best conversational assistant on the market. It was going to be fantastic. The challenge was we just didn't have the technology ready to deliver it. The tools just weren't there. There was something that we just couldn't cross, which was called the Uncanny Valley. So why am I bringing this up? Because there was an article. Where was this article? Dude, where is this article? I'll come back to you on it. But there was an article that came out yesterday about folks using AI shopping assistance. Because apparently we have about 60 to 70% of mobile shoppers who use AI shopping assistance or at least willing to give them a shot. But here's the issue is that nearly 70% of the people who use it bail because they get bad product recommendations. And let me tell you, chatbots aren't new. Chatbots have been around forever and most of us haven't exactly loved them. Right. You know the drill. You're stuck in some endless loop with a bot. They can't understand what you're asking. And does AI have the potential to actually fix this problem? The answer, in my opinion, is yes, Absolutely. Are we seeing AI being used for better conversation? You know what? Not really. I mean, the thing is, things are moving fast. AI platforms are sending over a billion referral visits to major websites. They. That's what kind of caught my eye yesterday. A billion referral visits. If you were in our AI workshops all last summer out of Cal State University, San Bernardino, here on Cook street at the ERC center, you'll know that we spoke to you and we trained you and we educated you and we gave you tools on how to be sighted and Sourced by the AI chatbots at the time, Chat GPT is number one. It still is.800 million weekly active users. Google Gemini was just coming around second. It's really catching up fast. And then you got Claw and you got Perplexity and you got Co Pilot, you got a bunch of others, and you've got by the way you've got a bunch of other search engines who are using AI in their search results, how do you get cited on that? We did workshops all last summer. Seeing the number now a billion referral visits, that's pretty powerful. Again, major websites are getting this because they have the funding and the resources available to do what they need to do. Target is seeing 40% monthly growth in traffic from ChatGPT. Amazon has a chatbot called Rufus. Did you even know that? Did you even know that Amazon had a chatbot AI chatbot called Rufus? I'm telling you, every time I use it, it's not very good, but apparently it has 300 million users and people who use it are 60% more likely to actually buy something. That's wild. Here's what I'll leave you with though. Okay. Last year we had about 12% of U.S. shoppers using AI assistance. That has jumped threefold. Now we're at about 35%. And here's something even wilder. Half of those consumers say that they'd let AI handle the entire shopping process, including payment. Wow. We told you agent to agent commerce was coming. It's now here in January of 2026. And here's some surveys and some data that says even the consumers are getting ready and are open to actually using this sort of agentic commerce. The only problem is trust. Trust is fragile. When they kind of, when the, when the experience kind of sucks, you kind of walk away and you don't really do much after one bad experience. Right. That's the problem. If you're a small business or a large enterprise here in the Coachella Valley and you want some assistance on putting this all together, I have a quite a few great developers and creatives in town who run, let's say chatbot development or customer service development. If you want to go high level and talk about how do you strategically create a foundation for AI customer service and sales, let's say, and loyalty, reach out to me at Sunshine fm. Happy to introduce you to our team at aicv, which is our in person events and training company. Or I'm happy to go ahead and give you some pointers if you want to go a bit deeper. You are listening to sunshine fm modern media for palm springs coachella. Sticking with chatbots or at least voice, A startup called Nuo raised quite a bit of money, like 25 million to scale receptionist platform. Why I'm bringing this up to you is because of a couple of reasons. One, we just talked about Chatbots, how they've basically been not Very good. How the consumers are kind of. They want a better chatbot, sir, you know, experience. They're just not getting it. And while we ran some workshops last year showing you how you could create your own AI assistant, and I was even at an, at an event this morning in Palm Desert where the facilitator presenter was talking about how he could easily create chatbots for you if you wanted. They're so simple to put together. My only. Actually, I would say my shouldn't say only. The challenge there is, this is if the chatbots are a representative of you and your company, it's not something that you should take lightly. And in my opinion, you certainly shouldn't just put one together just because you can. Yes, bunch of great tools out there. Create your own AI avatar, create your own AI assistant or, or rep who may know your data of your company or your menu or your pricing or whatever it is that you want to go ahead and share with the public. It is so easy to put these together, but so difficult to get that perfect experience where the person who's calling you or texting you, your customer, acquisition costs is where you're spending to get this person. You want them to have a delightful experience. And right now, most chatbot services don't have that reason why I'm bringing up newer to you. I know a few of the folks who are working with this and their human like AI receptionists are fantastic and they are going after, not the enterprise side of things, but the small and medium business. I am hoping, I wouldn't even say hoping. I think we've got kind of converging forces here. Right. Enterprises are providing great AI. I don't say great, pretty good AI services. Small, medium businesses are usually last to get these. So then they're kind of like the first to jump on, let's say AI models. And they, when they experiment, which I love, please experiment. But then they think these are the chatbots or these AI receptionists that they're going to use for their business. And two things happen. One, they're not very good because let's be, let's be frank about this. You're not developers or strategists to figure out what is the outcome you're looking for and how do we build this in the most, in the best way possible, number one. Number two, generally you give up after you're putting it together and you try and deploy it. You don't have all the security in place and the experience is not very good from the consumer's point of view. So you as a business owner either give up on it or just leave a mediocre product up. So I'm really glad that NIO is going after the small medium business. I've reached out to them to see we can bring them or at least bring their services to the Valley. And if so I'd be happy to maybe do a workshop or two sometime this year and we can go through how to set one of these up and how to actually get this personalized to your business. To date they've built about 15,000 AI agents, have about 200 certified partners. We're on the list to be one of them. We haven't been approved yet, but we'll get there. And early adoption has been led by medical practices, chiropractors, opticians, dental, led by restaurants, home service companies, etc, etc where a missed calls, a missed call to these generally translate to lost revenue. And according to the company data, small businesses miss about 20 to 40% of incoming calls due to staffing constraints and after hours inquiries. Ain't that the truth. How many times have have you as a consumer called a business and nobody picks up the phone just rings off the hook. And by the way, that's if you're using phones for their intended purposes calling or you call when you need something at you know, AC breaks and you're calling somebody at 7 or 8 or 9 o' clock at night and they've got an onshing service or worse, voicemail. Eek. Can an AI do this and make it even better? Well, the promise with Chatbots was always there. AI receptionist. I think we're getting to the point where yeah, they're going to be like your digital employee on payroll. David Yang, who's the co founder of New O basically says small businesses are under pressure to respond instantly and most still lose revenue simply because no one picks up the the phone. Ain't that the truth. David, I know this firsthand frustrates me. Coachella Valley. Most of your phone calling technology stack is outdated. Please get with it. At the very least train some of your staff on how to on phone etiquette. By the way, I can train your stuff on phone etiquette too if you don't want to spend the money on AI receptionists. I'll take that back. I could do it. I'm not interested. You're listening to Sunshine FM Modern media for Palm Springs Coachella. You are listening to Sunshine FM Modern Media for Palm Springs Coachella. Okay, still getting used to that. Okay. All right. So a follow up to a story we've been following in a story that we spoke about in depth last week. Ads. Ads are coming to your AI chat. OpenAI, as you may recall, had said that AI, I'm sorry, ads were coming to chat GPT. And then they also said it's not if you've got a pro plan or a premium plan, you won't see the ads. Thank you very much, Sam. But if you're on a free tier or a go tier, which is their new under $10 a month plan, this is happening. And according to reports, they've switched them on and people are seeing them. Here's why I think this matters, okay? OpenAI is burning cash at an astonishing rate. They've spent $2.5 billion in just the first half of last year. Meanwhile, only about 5% of their 800 million weekly active users actually pay for subscriptions. 5%, which by the way, that's a bit lower than I guess it should be. I don't know, I come from the mobile gaming virtual world and social gaming ecosystem. And in the gamification world, you may have heard me say this a few weeks ago, your kind of rule of thumbs, as it were, depending on what kind of game or what kind of app you're developing and what kind of audience you have, is you either have a 99. 1 rule or you have an 80 18. 2 rule. And what that means basically is this. 90% of your users are free. Freemium is what we used to call them. 9% actually pay for your subscription and you have 1% who are the whales, who are true fans obsessed with what you're providing and pay beyond what even the premium pairs do. So OpenAI is not alone. They've got 5% who pay. I'm one of that 5%. I pay my monthly subscription because I, I'm experimenting and I think I want a lot more of its features. Meanwhile, 95% of users are consuming massive computational resources which actual, which is actual real money and GPU power without spending a dime. And that is just unsustainable. So we knew ads were coming. And if they can get, this is their business, this is their pitch deck, by the way, because, you know, they are thinking of going public this year that if they can get ads to account for up to 20 of their revenue moving forward, they would be sustainable. Before I continue with what the ads look like on Chat GPT, quick reminder. Last week Anthropic, the makers of Claude AI and one of Chat GPT's, you know, main rivals, ran four Super bowl commercial, basically trolling ads in AI, they didn't say ads. In Chat GPT, they did say ads AI. But you could tell it was mostly a jib jab to chat GPT that went, that got under the skin of Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, who fired back, calling the commercials clearly dishonest and also said, look, we've got, we've got more people in Texas using chat GPT for free than the total number of people using Claude in the us Basically saying, look, you've got a different business model. You're going for the creme de la creme. Then he called it rich people, wealthy people. Meanwhile, we're trying to democratize access to AI. And how do you do that to 800 million global users without going bankrupt? But their business model is, yeah, there's going to be ads in there, right? How do you serve billions of people globally who can't afford subscriptions? You need ads to subsidize that access. Okay, so the case for ads, okay, I come from the marketing world. Ads. Well, unfortunately, or unfortunately, Web 1.1 was brilliant. Free. It was free spirited. It was just, you wanted information, you try and look for it, you, you'd stumble upon a website, you. It was just such a magical time. Web 1.0, Web 1.0, Web 2.0 is when the ads came along. Google, I mean even Facebook and all these great big behemoths basically turned in the Internet, captured all that value through banner ads and search ads, et cetera, et cetera, you name, you name it, it was all ads. So now we're left with an Internet that is basically ad supported, right? It doesn't work without the ads or subscriptions. Your choice. So the case for the ads are this. This may not be as bad as you may be thinking. Yes, the Claude ads were funny, but this may not be as bad as you think. There is precedent. Google, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, they all started free and then they eventually monetized through ads. It's just the playbook that's been around for the Internet for 20, 25 years. And for most users, ChatGPT is handling low value queries such as why is the sky blue? Or help me write an email. These are things people previously got for free via Google search. The friction of paying $20 a month for plus or $200 for pro is too high for casual use. So ads let OpenAI keep the service free while still generating revenue to pay for all that massive compute. OpenAI has also said we're building thoughtful guardrails. There'll be no ads for users under 18. No ads in conversations about health, mental health, or politics. Ads will be clearly labeled, placed outside the AI's responses. And they also say they won't influence what ChatGPT actually says. Users can opt out of personalization and delete their ad data. And crucially, advertisers only get aggregated metrics, no access to individual conversations. So the argument is this could work like Amazon's model, which is more like recommendations than intrusive display ads. For example, if you're asking ChatGPT for recipe ingredients, a sponsored suggestion might genuinely be useful. And done tastefully, ads could be value added rather than disruptive. Hey, let me know. Do you actually. Do you like personalized ads or do you turn that off and you don't mind what ads come to your feeds on social or Google or wherever you spend most of your days? And the case against ads? Well, unlike most platforms out there, people are using ChatGPT for deeply personal things. There are companions. They're advisors, they're therapists. There's an implicit trust that the AI is working for you, not for advertisers, which obviously is how it feels on Facebook and how it feels on Google. How it feels pretty much Everywhere else. Spotify, YouTube. Feels like all these platforms are designed for advertisers, not for us as consumers. So even if OpenAI promises ads won't influence responses, the question of authenticity lingers. Will the answers ANSWERS? Will the AI's answers serve users or advertisers? And the privacy angle is thorny too. Even with opt outs, the fact that your personal conversations could inform ad targeting, even if aggregated, feels invasive to many. I listened to this fantastic podcast and they were basically saying, these guys are basically on the frontier of the future. And they basically says, look, privacy is gone. If you think privacy's still something relevant, it's not. And somebody else fought for the other side, which was privacy is a huge thing. Privacy equals freedom. I don't know how you feel about privacy, but if I speak to all of you out there, 8 of 8 out of 10 of you want privacy, but you've chosen to give it away anyway. There's only one or two people I know that use DuckDuckGo as their search engine. And if you haven't heard of DuckDuckGo, there's your answer. Privacy. You've given it away already. And the slippery slope is you look, right now it may be clearly label sponsored modules, but tomorrow, who knows? Have you seen Google lately? It started off with clearly defined sponsored results These are ads now, that kind of font for sponsored results. And advertiser info is like so small. It's like the, it's like the disclaimers of the side effects and the prescription ads, right, that you see on the telly. And one thing we got to be thinking about too, will the ads be user first or business first? Because we know that OpenAI needs revenue and advertisers need ROI. And that creates inherent pressure to make ads more prominent, more personalized and more frequent. It's that whole incentive framework that we talk about here constantly on the show. And chat GPT is not dumb. And Sam Altman says he can't lose that trust. That's basically the one thing it has going for for them is trust. They cannot lose that trust. So their communication across the board has to be so, like almost perfect to make sure that we as consumers still feel like ChatGPT and me, we're a team. Bottom line, classic Internet trade off. You get free access funded by ads or you pay for an ad free experience. OpenAI is betting that most users will accept some ads in Exchange for keeping ChatGPT free. And honestly, I do believe they're right. Because most people aren't going to pay 20 bucks a month for casual AI help. It's funny because even last summer I was talking to people if they paid for the chat GPT and most people came through the workshops, except for the folks who returned to the workshops, most people weren't paying for the chat GPT 20 bucks a month. And I was actually shocked. I was surprised. To me, 20 bucks a month is like affordable in, in the sense of the following. If they can afford to go to Starbucks two or three times a week, which I know these folks, I asked, do maybe give up your Starbucks to tap into the world's intelligence. If you're spending money on some subscriptions like Netflix or Prime Video or Paramount, really Paramount or Peacock or you name it, consider trading one, which is giving you entertainment, which is fine, by the way. You need to chill for this access to really experts on tap. And the bottom line is, isn't whether the ads will work, it's whether they're going to be implemented in a way that respects this unique, intimate nature of conversational AI. Something that most of us have not experienced this frequently and this deeply. And if you listened to my show yesterday when I talked about this new term that you're going to start hearing about, or maybe you won't, who knows, maybe it's too kind of too new and you won't hear it for a while, but I do believe we're moving from an attention economy to an attachment economy. Listen to my show yesterday if you didn't catch it live. I also do signals from the show on my website and in a weekly catch up newsletter so you'll hear a lot more about me talking about AI companions and AI bonding and this attachment economy. You're listening to. Modern media for palm springs coachella. Thanks, Ronnie. She's also one of our AI artists on Sunshine FM Records. Okay, so I mentioned I was at a AI presentation, AI training earlier this morning. It was held here in Palm Desert, small little cohort. And one of the, one of the comments that the presenter made was, you can get this social media post, 10 of them done in less than five minutes. What used to take you half a day. You can write all these campaigns and all these emails. They used to take you a few hours. You can do it now in one minute. You can create these apps, these apps that are magical, that used to take weeks, if not months and lots of money. Now you can just make them in less than, less than a minute. Nothing wrong there. But the presenter then went on to also say, you'll have so much more time to do what you really want to do. And so a couple of things occurred to me, and they occurred to me purely because I've experienced this for the last two and a half years in both my training and the brands that I consult with. And by the way, my own personal use and professional use of these AI tools and models, I'll have so much more time to do the things that I want to do, like go play golf, like go watch the Premier League. And like he said, I'll meet you at happy hour because I'll get off work early. Is that really what will happen? Ask yourself. If you're an employee, is your boss going to say, oh, you got your work done earlier than normal, Take the afternoon off. If you run a business and you've got your social media posts done in an hour instead of the entire morning, are you taking the rest of that morning to go work on other things? Maybe, maybe. Or maybe you're just going to be asked. Or personally, you're just going to push yourself to be more productive or do more so. A recent study said that workers who adopt AI tools are experiencing burnout at higher rates as workloads expand rather than contract. And that was by Harvard Business Review yesterday. The findings challenge the tech industry's core promise that artificial intelligence would lighten the burden on employees. Exactly what I heard this morning and I come back preparing for this show and here it is. Study tells you not so fast. It was an eight month study conducted from April to December of last year. UC Berkeley researchers Aruna Ranganathan and Shinchi Magiy observed what happened when employees at a 200 person US based technology company genuinely embrace generative AI. The company provided access to commercial AI tools through enterprise subscriptions, but did not mandate their use, which I'm seeing Across the Coachella Valley, folks are buying licenses or seats without much training. Just a quick hey, this is what we're going to do, blah blah blah. That's a separate conversation now across more. Across across this 200 person technology company, the researchers found a consistent pattern. Nobody was pressured to hit new targets, yet people simply started doing more because the tools made more feel achievable. Rather than leaving work earlier, employees voluntarily expanded their to do lists, allowing work to bleed into lunch breaks and late evenings. One engineer told the researchers, you had thought that maybe because you could be more productive with AI, then you can save some time, you can work less, but in reality you don't work less, you just work the same amount or even more. The researchers documented what they call workload creep or expectation creep. Once teams learned they could ignore generate drafts or code or analysis in minutes, their KPIs and throughput targets quietly ratcheted up. Workers increasingly stepped into responsibilities that previously belonged to others, with product managers writing code and researchers taking on engineering tasks. Now, what would that mean locally, seeing that we don't have that many tech startups in the Valley? Well, just give some thought to hospitality or retail or in the case of social media marketing agencies. If, if this AI agent that you've created out of the blue is going to write 10 social media posts for you, and let's just say 10 average social media posts for you versus you working four hours on them. And it does this for you in half an hour. How are you going to spend the other three and a half hours? You're just going to prepare more social media posts for tomorrow or for the rest of the week. Or maybe you're going to turn the social media posts into more repurposed content like blogs or maybe scripts for videos or maybe another platform that you might be in. Your workload actually in reality gets heavier because you are doing more. And now your bosses or your co workers also know, hey, wow, this is magical. You don't necessarily necessarily say I can do more, you just end up doing more, which is great for productivity. But here's the thing. It's not good for your mental health and it's not good for your sense of value, especially when you're trading in your hours for a paycheck. The conversational interface of AI makes initiating tasks seamless, eliminating issues like blank page syndrome. Oh my goodness. If you're a social media manager, you know, know that right off the bat. I'm reading this as we go along. So the findings align with broader concerns about AI's workplace impact. Previous research from the Upwork Research Institute found that 77% of employees using AI tools said they had added to their workload. A Quantum Workplace survey showed that frequent AI users report 45% higher burnout rates compared to those who rarely or never use the technology. That's from cnbc. The Berkeley research has warned that without intentional guidelines or an AI usage, what they call an AI practice, what I call in the boot camps and workshops we do, and AI Council, the inherent tendency of AI assisted work is not to reduce workloads, but to intensify them. And that workload creep can in turn lead to cognitive fatigue, burnout and weakened decision making. The productivity surge enjoyed at the beginning can give way to lower quality work turnover and other problems. Wild, right? Maybe not wild, but just wanted you to know as my devoted listeners, thank you so much that you have to be intentional in how you use AI, you have to be responsible in how you implement AI, and you have to be thoughtful about strategically implementing AI into your daily workflow and what you want your outcomes to be, either personally or professionally. As always, you're listening to Sunshine FM Modern Media for Palm Springs Coachella. If you've got any questions, any comments you want to get on the show, let's talk about this. Any aspect of AI. There is no judgment here. I want this to be a conversation because none of us really know how AI is going to implement impact, disrupt the way we do our business, the way we live our lives here in Coachella Valley. And I'm here to bring this to you so we can have these conversations in public. Have yourselves a fantastic Tuesday. We'll see you again Wednesday.
