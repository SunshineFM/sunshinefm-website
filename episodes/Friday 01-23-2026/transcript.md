It's, It's foreign. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Pretty soon that's going to be good. Good afternoon. Because we're going to move this show starting next week to the afternoons. Sunshine fm Modern media for Palm Springs Coachella. This is sat. What are we doing here? Well, let me tell you, AI startups, startup ecosystem in the Coachella Valley. We've been dreaming about it, we've been thinking about it for two decades. How do we get a startup ecosystem in the Coachella Valley? Well, who knows what the real answer is, but with AI, there's a strong possibility that is closer to reality than a dream. Sunshine FM and our, let's say on the ground company, aicv, which is AI Coachella Valley, we're trying to move that needle. We're trying to move the needle about what it would look like to make as many people in the Coachella Valley as AI fluent as possible. And how can we attract some great founders and builders and idea people to the Coachella Valley? In addition to upskilling and up leveling, all the folks are already here, you career changers, you entrepreneurs, you students at high school and in college or the desert, and in Cal State University, San Bernardino, Palm Desert campus. How can we get you all not just to up level your AI skills, but to then provide it to all our small businesses and startups and enterprises in the valley so that we can lift all boats? Now, I also have a personal vision about this. I have several friends up in the Bay Area that work for some of these AI foundational companies and adjacent startups. And at some point this year, over the next 18 to 24 months, they are all going to be newly minted multi millionaires. And my goal for the, for 2026 is to convince one or two or several of them to consider the Coachella Valley as their next step. They can go to Miami, they can go to Texas, they can go to Utah. By the way, that is growing like crazy in terms of how many people are going to Utah. And, and there's a great tech ecosystem system happening there. So as they're flush with cash and they're thinking about the next chapter, possibly, you know, getting married, having kids. I am trying to convince them on a daily basis you may want to consider Coachella Valley and here are the reasons why. But first of all, I don't have the reasons. All I know is the only thing I can guarantee them is 350 days of sunshine and blue skies. Hence Sunshine FM. So you're listening today and I appreciate, appreciate it. Thank you so, so, so much. If you listen to yesterday's show. I did some on the ground reporting from the event at the Agua Caliento Cultural Museum. And what I thought were, you know, what worked, what didn't work. And obviously I have an opinion about all of this. So it was an on the ground reporting through my own lens of where I think we should be going, not just having conversations that we basically had two and a half years ago, but that's a different story. So we just heard there was a couple of AI tunes. Sunshine FM is basically 24.7ai radio and we make no apologies about it. Some are great, some are so so. Some are going to be embarrassing, but that's okay. We're heading into this AI world and one of the conversations I want to have with you today towards the end of this show is what is the consumer appetite for AI generated entertainment? We'll get to that later. Okay. A lot happening just like usual in the AI world. The AI bubble. We talked about Chat GPT adding ads to its free service and a new $8 a month tier. I would love to know what you think about this. I've already had conversations with, with many, many people about putting ads into your chats, as it were. Now, obviously if you're at the $20 or the $200 Enterprise Teams account, you are not going to get ads. And I put this in quote yet, but, but you know, at the end of the day, these are tech companies and they have monetization goals. They have to, they're, they're raising so much money. And I will also talk deeply about OpenAI in 2026 because I do have some, you know, questions and so we'll get into that too. But I would love to hear what you think about ads generally. You know, do you love ads? I mean, I love super bowl sometimes for the game, but mostly for how much the marketing agencies and ad agencies, what they're signing off on and how much money they spend on super bowl advertising. Love that concept of it. I come from a traditional ad and marketing background anyway, so that stuff still fires me up. I don't like ads popping up in my digital journeys. I'm sure most of you don't either. And so wherever I can, I pay the premium so I can avoid the ads, but most people can't. Right at the end of the day, how much do you pay for your Facebook or Instagram? The answer is zero. And the reason for that is because 80% or 87% of the feed that you're Getting is not necessarily from your friends and your network, it's from folks that the algorithm algorithms thinks you should be paying attention to. And in that mix are obviously promoted and sponsored and underwritten ads. You can call them whatever you want, but they're all just advertising, right? So it's no surprise that Chat GPT has come out in the last couple of weeks and said, yep, ads are coming. I would love to know what you're thinking about was it was. It was obviously going to happen. It'll be interesting to see that if you're searching for airlines on ChatGPT or if you're searching for pizza joints near you on ChatGPT, if you're looking for appliances, I can see that the ads are going to be hopefully pretty useful if they, if they know quite a bit about you. The interesting part is when you're talking to your chatbot as a companion, as a therapist, as a significant other, as it were. And we'll get into that one of these days. I'll do a deep dive in AI companionship. I already do a bunch of presentations around the valley on AI companionship anyway, so there's a lot of learning I've done over the last two and a half years about that. So it'll be interesting to see when you upload your medical records and your medical files and your. And you're asking your Chat GPT doctor, as it were, about that scar or lesion on your shoulder or whatever it might be, if they just not if they decide how they're going to incorporate some sort of monetization in that thread. Now, they have said, right? Now, remember, this is very early, that sensitive topics like mental health and health care and even politics, they are not going to underwrite that or show ads. Okay, fair enough. Let's just say they don't do that in 2026. You are putting, not just you, me, you and everybody else is using ChatGPT. We're feeding it so much personal, so much private information. And by the way, if you're not right now, you will. It's just one of those trends. It's just one of those slopes we've already started sliding down. If you're not doing it now, you will just take my word for it. So we are feeding it all this private information already. And so let's just presume they're not going to do it for 2026. We'll take them for their word. Okay, thanks, Sam Altman. But 2027, well, it'll be a different story. So all that information that you fed it last year and this year they're not going to not use it. Right. They won't use it for training, but they'll definitely use it for ad targeting. Because really, when you think about it, Google search is fantastic. They do. I mean their big giant power money maker is search intent, Facebook and Meta, Instagram, WhatsApp, their fantastic advertising powerhouse is because they know quite a bit about you and your network and your preferences. ChatGPT and down the line, Google Gemini. They say they're not going to touch ads right now, but down the line Google Gemini and all the other AI chatbots that we use on a daily basis, they are going to get to know you even more than Google and Facebook Meta. At least that's my directional sense, even just looking at my own use case of how I utilize these chatbots. Yeah, I am sharing a lot more personal, private information with this technology than any other technology prior. And so just, you know, skate to where the puck is going. A year, two years, three years from now, do the AI companions and AI assistants and AI agents that we currently are just getting to get to invite into our world, will they get to know us even more? So yeah, there's, there is no two ways about it. So ads were always coming, ads, us coming in the next quarter. If you don't like ads, that's okay, just get the premium. If you have the freebie, just know the ads are coming your way. As a matter of fact, I am thinking, I thought about this over the weekend. I am thinking of setting up one of my ChatGPT accounts to be a free account just so that I can also experience what kind of ads and where they're showing up and how they're, how they're presenting the ads to me. So I think yeah, I'll go ahead and set up a one of my accounts as a freebie. And in the meantime, if you're experiencing, when you start experiencing the ads in your chat bots, reach out. DM me, get on the show. Let's talk about it. Let's have this conversation about ads. If you're a marketing agency, let's talk about how you as a marketing agency are presenting ads in ChatGPT to your clients. And by the way, if you're not already thinking about how to present. Ads in chat GPT to your clients, this new surface area you are behind already. It's already happening in a bunch of startups that I'm, I'm connected to in the Bay Area and in la. I know it's also happening in New York, although I don't know too many people in New York. And again, don't be, don't be late to this game. Palm Springs, Coachella. We have an opportunity, especially marketing agencies, to really offer something powerful and novel to your clients. Now, the argument could be made our clients just prefer traditional tv, local tv, radio, Facebook ads. Okay, fair enough. I'll leave that to you to figure out if that's going to be your call to action or not. I know that Sunshine FM and AICV are already playing in this game. I shouldn't say playing experimenting in here. We talked about it last summer in one of our workshops at Cal State where we figured ads were going to be around the corner and what can you do as marketing agencies? So we don't know the answers, but we do know that the way to get the answers is experiment. Okay? Experiment, experiment, experiment. All right, so another great little story that popped up in my universe. Perhaps it popped up in your universe too. Who knows? Is Apple. I'd say most of my listeners have iPhones. If my workshops in 2025 were any indication. I'd say it was like an 80, 20, 80% were iPhone users, 20% were. You go Android. I don't have an iPhone. I'm a Google Pixel person. But in my studio I have a Mac. And obviously I'm not a big Siri user because they don't have an iPhone. But all you iPhone users, you have been so upset with Siri and so upset with Apple and so upset that Google's got fantastic AI chatbots and so. And that OpenAI's got fantastic AI chatbots and Claude does. I'm not going to go as far as saying Microsoft does, but you know, copilot, it's out there. And for the first time, Apple, especially iPhone users, have felt a little bit kind of second class citizens. Well, get this. Not only did Apple make a great agreement contract with Google to basically be the engine behind the new revamped Siri for 2026, we, we spoke about that last week. But news in the last 48 hours is, is Apple is reportedly developing an AI pin, a thin flat disc about the size of an airtag. But get this, with cameras, microphones and a speaker. Wow. Holy moly. The idea would be that it could understand your personal context and use AI to proactively do helpful things, which is what serial is supposed to do, right? At least from an audio first manner. Well, you know, a couple of things about this. Having another piece of hardware has not necessarily gone over too well over the course of history in terms of Silicon Valley way back if not you remember anybody remembers Google Glass that was early days that people didn't like to be photographed or videotaped without them knowing. Well a decade and a half has gone by and a lot of people have just kind of got used to knowing that they're being recorded in one way or another. We still don't like it, but the kind of sentiment has kind of softened a bit about this. Right. We all know that humane AI pin if anybody was around in Kickstarter world and the rabbit and whole and by the way friend that was a big friend is still around by the way. These are all little hardware plays where it doesn't live on your phone. It's actually a separate device. Whether it's on your ear, on your lapel, whether you're wearing it like meta AI glasses there is going to be a fight for hardware or wearables that you kind of take around with you beyond your phone. So the aipin didn't go as very didn't go as well. Open AI announced last week that they are coming out with like an earbud, an AI earbud which we'll go into in into deeper a bit later, maybe next week. Because you know Apple's AirPods basically are like a huge 23 billion dollar a year segment of their own Apple ecosystem and I think OpenAI coming after them with something like an AI earbud is pretty powerful. So Apple AI Pin A early reports say it would be worn like a pendant or necklace which you know, has its own issues. Apple is also reportedly working on AI glasses Again it seems like that might be the natural extension of the phone. I know a ton of people who love the meta Ray Ban glasses. I don't know anybody in town, Palm Springs, Coachella that's actually wearing them on a daily basis. Even our software engineer in resident at aicv he says he has them but I've never seen him wear them. So Habib, if you're listening, let me see how what it feels like when you're wearing these things. I think at the end of the day Apple right now is doing what they do best. They have logistics, they have supply chain. They know hardware, they know design, they know what people generally love in their iPhones and their Macs and their earbuds. Didn't do too well with a Vision Pro but you know, that's who wants to live with that thing on your head on a daily basis? Not consumers. Business to business. I think that's pretty powerful. But maybe this time around, you know, they'll, they'll basically do something that shows the world that they are not that far behind on AI. All right, so. I think the, the agreement that Google made with Apple that is pretty interesting in and of itself and we'll talk about that at some point. What I do want to get into is my wheelhouse, which is Hollywood, music industry, entertainment, culture and how AI fits into all of this. I'm not sure I think I mentioned this yesterday. Ben Affleck was on a podcast and he talked about give a 20 minute sermon about AI in Hollywood, go pull it up in one of the, one of your favorite chat bots. I'm sure they'll know all about it. I have a bunch of friends in the entertainment industry and we've been going back and forth about this for many, many years currently. It's tough for me to figure out where the entertainment industry as a whole is, you know, where sits where it positions itself when it comes to AI. You know, as the mu. As the movie studios and music labels continue to forge deals with AI firms, hundreds of artists are joining together to protest AI's place in entertainment. And yesterday, today's Friday. Yesterday, Thursday, a coalition of writers, actors and musicians and industry say adjacent folks launched a petition titled Stealing isn't Innovation. They're protesting against AI training with unauthorized content. The petition, which counts Scarlett Johansson, Cate Blanchette REM among its signatory, has amassed more than 800 signatures. That's all. 800amassed. 800. I mean if that was like 8,000 or 80,000, that would be amassed. 800 signatures. Isn't that just like a. I don't know, who knows? I just, I just read that out loud and just went, that's not them very many. Anyway. The campaign targets AI companies and tech giants for their illegal mass harvesting of copyrighted works. Oh my goodness, I think that ship may have sailed. But I am all about giving credit where it's due. Now this stealing is an innovation which is another of, you know, art. You know, we've all heard songs that sound like songs that you heard maybe a decade ago, two decades ago. Feels like remixing and regenerating and really, at the end of the day, what movies are really that original? I mean, a lot of it. Again, I love original storytelling and original cinematic uses of technology, but storytelling in and of itself is pretty much there are formulas and there are certain just things that we as humans love to know about, right? Or relate to. So I'm all about this standing up against the AI companies and we want to get compensated for using our likeness or our words, etc. But something that comes to my mind about that is I brought this question up to Kelly, who's the AI artist in Palm Desert, who was at the AI event in Palm Springs on Wednesday night. And I asked her if you know, Suno or the record labels or Spotify or YouTube would do anything about AI generated content versus not AI generated content. And she basically is of the mind that that ship has already sailed. That's why I use that term. They're pushing against the tech giants for the illegal mass harvesting of copyrighted works. Okay, I can get. I can get that. AI companies are endangering artists careers while exploiting their practiced craft using human art and other creative works without authorization to amass billions in corporate earnings. Human artistry campaign senior advisor Dr. Moya McTeer said in a statement. The effort follows a broader fight by Hollywood actors and artists to separate their work from the technology. Okay. In December, a number of big entertainment industry names launched the Creators Coalition on AIs. I remember this. Aiming to organize a central hub for cross industry discussions about how AI is impacting the entertainment industry. The coalition counts Joseph Gordon Levitt, Natasha Leon, Daniel Kwan and several hundred others as members. Okay. It seems to me those two must be working together. If not, why not? But not everyone is so strongly opposed to the tech's use in creative flows. Oh my goodness, they're bringing up one of my favorite AI companies. On Wednesday, eleven Labs launched the eleven album. Yes, I know I played yesterday. I played Liza Minnelli's first song, AI Song on there. The 11 album is the fruits of a partnership between the Voice AI company and artists Liza Minnelli, Art Garfunkel and more. Using AI to co create studio studio quality music. Well, it was okay. I mean it's funny because if Brad is listening, he's a radio station. Owner of several radio stations. I want to say several, but maybe it's only one or two. I can't rem. I was listening to it on a drive yesterday just to see what local radio. I do this every once in a while to see what local radio sounds like. And while classic rock, I know inside out, I recognize all the bands or recognize all the artists. I recognize the songs. That's fine. That's not what I'm there for. I went over to a couple of the other local radio stations and in genres I'm not familiar with, such as, let's just say, you know, Edmund, a dance music actually Even country, really, when I was going through the dials and listening to the different stations, honestly, I could not tell or I questioned whether this was AI generated music. Even the AI generated music that we play on this station, number one, we promise you, it's all AI generated. Now, the lyrics may not be usually the lyrics I'm orchestrating and I'm directing purely because I am trying to make it more hyper local for Palm Screens, Coachella, and so they have a different kind of vibe and feel to it. But all the most, all the other songs I was hearing on the radio yesterday when I was driving around, I genuinely was saying to myself, okay, this is AI generated. Or it easily could be AI generated because I couldn't discern the. The song itself. I couldn't discern the artists and the sound and the vocals. And obviously I'm, I'm, you know, I'm an oldie. So classic rock, I can, you know, differentiate a Springsteen and a Jackson Brown from an AC DC and a Led Zeppelin in this current state of music, as it were. Again, I'm not the target market, but when I was going through this, these stations, they could have all just been AI generated music. And number one, it didn't really move me as much. One or two did because I went, oh, that's kind of interesting. And I couldn't tell if it was AI generated or an artist that I just don't know anything. Everything about could have been the latter. So, I mean, at the end of the day, studio quality music, what does that really mean? I don't know. So, carrying on the story, the partnership follows several major music labels partnering with AI powered music platforms like Suno and Udio. I use both of those, by the way. They both have their strengths and weaknesses, signaling that the music industry may be more keen on leveraging AI than its silver screen counterparts. Keep in mind silver screen counterparts. Disney made a big agree arrangement with OpenAI as well. More on that later. Some, meanwhile, might see a middle ground. In his annual letter to the YouTube community published Wednesday, CEO Neil Mohan highlighted that while putting an end to AI slope and unregulated deep fakes remains a priority, AI will be a boon to the creatives who are ready to lean in. Okay, is that middle ground or is that basically just saying, just get used to it, man, just get used to it? All right, yeah, that's. Just come out and say, neil, please. Putting an end to AI slop, an unregulated deep fakes remains a priority. I don't know about that. Okay, so according To Nat Rubio Licht, senior reporter, here's a. Here's a kind of take. These moves mark the latest in Hollywood's heated battle to figure out where, if at all, AI fits into the creative process. Nat, I wonder what you're saying. If at all, it does fit, right? But generative AI's growing foothold in the creative industry itself represents a paradox. Yeah, I think that. Great work. Word, there's foothold. I need to start using that too. I just feel like it's a foothold and yes, we can, you know, manage it as best as we can, but they're here and they're here to stay. Generative models rely on authentic works by real people to create possible mimicry. But these models, it seems, are threatening the livelihoods of those who create that art in the first place. Oh, my goodness. Great, great line there, Nat. While generative AI feeds on artists to survive, artists have been creating for several millennia without technology. All right, you know, I loved, I would love for you to get on this show and let's talk about the pros, the cons, the promise, and the peril of AI in creativity. I had this conversation with my son the other day and it all boiled down to, I mean, started up here, but it all boiled down to, okay, what is the definition of creativity? Because he argued that for thousands of years, art and words and storytelling is just built upon previous arts and words and storytelling. And he's not necessarily wrong. Now that we've had copyright for about 100 and something years and there's a strong possibility might be going away. I was asked this question in one of my workshops last summer and I specifically said the way copyright is, the way we've grown up with copyright and the way the copyright laws are right now, they slowly going to fade away. I might be wrong and maybe there's a fight here, you know, for as long as I live that still holds somewhat of a line. I just feel as though. Copyright is dead. And it really, really, really, really, in my opinion, comes down to consumer appetite, consumer preference, consumer consumers voting with their dollars. And as my son would say, if you look at the history of what, how consumers spend their money, they're okay spending money on slop, slop, music slop, movies slop, TV slop, reporting slop everywhere. And this, by the way, was before AI slop was a term. He's not wrong. He's got a good head on his shoulders and I think I will agree with him. It just comes down to consumers voting with their wallets and their Preferences. Okay, so you got any, you got any thoughts on this? You got any opinions? I want to know about them. I want to learn from you. Get on the show, reach out to me and let's have that conversation. I think it is important moving forward. By the way, it's really important for Sunshine FM because this is the entire platform that we're building on. The promise and the peril, the good, the bad. Why would you want to listen to the AI music that we're generating here? Because in between the music, we're giving you these AI information, AI education, AI updates, how AI is going to affect you in your personal life and your business life. How AI is going to help you whether you're a student, how AI is going to help you in your career. What is the workforce being trained on now? What will the jobs of tomorrow entail? And what is the future of Palm Springs Coachella beyond a resolution resort community or agricultural community on the east side of the valley? What are we going to be beyond what we traditionally are? And maybe we, we won't ever have a. Another tech, another sector like every leader has, has wanted for the last 20 plus years. I think AI, we have an opportunity. We're certainly not going to be the epicenter of AI like some city council members say that ship has passed. Not that we had much of a chance, but let's say we had a chance a couple of years ago. I think that ship has passed. So the reason why you listen to Sunshine FM is because in between some of this great AI generated music and some not so great AI generated music, you. You have an opportunity to help, you know, create your own AI generated music and have it shown and have it played on air. You have an opportunity to come on the show and have the conversations. You have the opportunity to support some of the AI artists that are slowly coming up in our, let's say, record label. And you have an opportunity to help shape the future of Palm Springs Coachella as we go into an AI driven world. Now, if I had all my hardware set up, which I don't, by the way, because I ran into a bunch of coding issues. If you, if you've been listening to my show for the last couple of weeks, you'll know that I've been using Claude code to help create some of the infrastructure of this radio station. And while some of it is really cool, cool and working, some of it fell apart over the weekend, actually last Friday. And so I was in coding hell over the weekend. And even this week I'm using Claude code. I'm using Google's Anti Gravity. I'm playing around with Cursor as a software engineer loves to do. And, and I'm doing this without any outside help because I'm. What I'm. The experiment is can an individual manage to do this him or herself? And that's what I'm trying to do. So anyway, all this week, coding hell for sure. And so I have this piece of hardware that hopefully if I can tap into some of the station IDs, the interstitials, some sound effects that by the way, AI generated again. So to let you know that we're moving from topic to topic, I would press that button right about now because we are moving from one topic to the final topic of the of today's show. Now here's what I want to kind of talk about and kind of have you think about over the weekend. Okay. And what that is is this last summer, and even though the autumn series that we did at Cal State in our AICV workshops, I was often asked, you know, which is the best model. And in 2024 and most of 2025, every other week, each one of the models was leapfrogging each other with ChatGPT staying generally always in the lead. And every time Chat GPT came out with a feature or a product update, we'd go into it, we'd deep dive into it and we'll share with our attendees how to use it, how to think about it moving forward. Right. I think as all these foundational models have very similar capabilities. Now when I'm asked which is the best, I don't have an answer about which is the best. What I do say is here's how we use things, here's how we use AI in Sunshine FM and at AICV, we don't use one AI, we use many. We use all the models from OpenAI, all the ChatGPTs, and I even go back from 5.2 sometimes and I go back to some of the older ones because they're good enough for what I need. And by the way, they're less expensive in terms of token cost. I use Anthropic. We've been using Anthropic since early days and now with them, big move into cloud Claude code and Claude co work. We're experimenting with those coding. Myself, I'm experimenting. That's why I'm running to some code hell issues. But that's a separate story. We use Google Gemini, I use xai. I played around with Mistral in the part in the Past I've done deep seek. We play around with a bunch of these. Not because we're trying to be fancy about this. It's because these different models, they all think differently. Now, you may not feel it unless you're using this on a daily basis, but they do feel like they think differently. And if that's the case, and it certainly is my experience, different jobs need different kinds of thing thinking. And what I want you to think about as a local founder or a small business owner is why would you run your entire business on a single kind of intelligence? So when people hear multimodal, you know, some folks imagine something expensive or complicated, but it's really much closer to how we humans already work. In other words, we don't ask the same person to do our accounting, design our brand, write legal copy, or DJ a local AI generated radio station. You generally assemble a team. Multi model AI is that same idea. One model might be better at reasoning and writing. I have my favorites. I'm sure you, you do too. Another is better at coding or data manipulation. Another is even better at images, audio or media. And another is better at speed and scale. So there are tools out there, they're like aggregators where you can sign up for them and they have access to all the different foundational models and ones you've never heard of. And they'll also sometimes guide you into which tool might be good for which purpose. Whether it's words, whether it's text or images or video or research or analysis. That's one way of going. And we do play around when I say we, AICV does play around with some of these aggregators. I also play around with the actual foundational models and the, say, the larger, well known brands that build on top of those foundational models. Purely because I need to be able to tell you what I'm seeing firsthand and how I'm experiencing it. Because I want you to know this is me, hands on, experimenting with this stuff so that I can talk to you about it more credibly. I guess what I'm trying to say to you is, as a small business owner, as a founder, do not get locked in, okay? The most important thing is here is the minds. Your mindset matters more than the software that you choose. And so what I'm going to say is what I've always said, which is experimentation matters more than optimization. Right now we're still in the taste formation era of AI. Most people don't even know which model they trust, which one matches their thinking style, which one Actually saves them time instead of creating friction. That's another story I will get into next week. Are you finding yourself getting more work on your desk using AI because you can do so much or the promise is that you can do so much and if that's the case, are you kind of getting like me getting overloaded or the amount of productivity gains you're feeling that just result in wanting to do more? Let's have that conversation. And while you can hear me and I can definitely give you shortcuts to which ones to go to. So DM me if you've got specific use cases that you want to know which models to use. Most of the time you cannot discover which tool is good for your business just by reading reviews or watching YouTube videos or scrolling through Instagram or Twitter. You're going to discover it when you use these multiple models side by side. That's why we always encourage experimentation in all our workshops. You experiment with your time and your budget. Not everyone's going to need five subscriptions. I think I have a ton more than that. But that's a separate story. But we're all going to benefit more if you just try more than just one. So let me make it kind of a bit more real for you. If you're a small local business, you can imagine one model is helping you with marketing copy and social posts. You can reach out to us and I'll be happy to introduce you to a handful of marketing agencies in town that use AI and came to our workshop. So I know how they're using in and I'm sure they even gotten better over the last few months. You may have another model that helps with operations, SOPs and planning. And you may have another one that handles customer FAQs or scheduling and another one assisting leadership with strategy and thinking through decisions. If you're not using any one of these models for a thought partner as like a co founder in your business, you're missing out basically in the lowest hanging fruit out there. And while it might sound like that's a whole bunch of stuff you got to kind of manage. Yeah, in a way it is. But think of it this way. What you're basically doing is you're dividing up the cognitive labor because at the end of the day, none of these models are doing the work for you. They're doing. They're helping you co create and co think and co write. Okay, so you're co venturing on this. And most importantly, and you know, I have several of my colleagues both here in Coachella Valley and in la we talk about this all the time, is you have to be intentional about keeping humans in the loop. Experimenting with AI, you need to make your own value decision about not replacing people. But you're doing this because you're reducing mental overload and you're trying to give your team some leverage. This is going to be especially powerful for when you have people on your team that happen to wear three or four or five hats, which I know some of you do. And you've got to give them the tools to be able to do what you want them to do without turning in, without burning out, basically. So while two years ago, actually, you know, two and a half years ago and all, most of last year, it seemed like you were going to try and figure out which one was your favorite model and then you're going to bet the farm on it. That is fading away. I know that I'd say 9 out of 10 people are talked about just on the street. They're using ChatGPT, they don't know that using Gemini. If they're in the Google ecosystem, they just see an AI mode or Gemini chatbot and they're going to see a whole bunch of super bowl commercials about that. But they don't necessarily equate that with AI. Right now, most people think Chat GPT is AI and that's it. I think what we've found over the last year and a half is if, when you, when you start experimenting, you will start seeing that Claude feels different than Gemini, Gemini feels different than GPT and those differences will matter depending on what you're doing. So if you have any questions about this, reach out. I'm happy to introduce you to some developers, some marketers, some creatives who can help guide you without any. Well, they might, I'm sure they have their own personal preferences, as I do, but hopefully they'll guide you in ways that leave you with the options and then they'll give you some leadership on that if you're looking for that. Okay, think of it this way. You have choices right now, forget AI, just in general technology, you have choices like iOS or Android, mobile or desktop. You have Mac or PC or Linux, you have Photoshop or Canva or Figma. You're using one or a mix of them. Each have their strengths and each have their trade offs. So I'm going to questions I'm going to leave you with is this. If you're a founder, if you're a shop owner, a creative or a consultant or an enterprise manager, if AI is becoming a thinking partner. Do you want just one voice in the room or a small council? And this basically is something I've been saying for the last two and a half years and if you're in a couple of cities that I was in conversations with, I had said at the time, and I'll continue to say so. One of the top five things you have to do as an enterprise and as an organization is don't put this on one person to be the AI guru or the AI leader or the AI ambassador, yes, you need them, but don't put it on one person. You want to put together a small council, folks from hr, folks from legal, from folks from tech, folks from sales and marketing, folk across the various departments. You want one person from each one of those departments and you create an AI council. This is no different. When you are thinking about which AI tools, put together a small council of AI tools that you're experimenting with and you're going to start seeing where they fit. The goal isn't about chasing every shiny tool. It's about resilience, adaptability and choice. And the real advantage I think that folks are going to start benefiting from is flexibility. AI is not. AI is not settling into one winner, it's settling into roles. The people who thrive won't be the ones who pick the best models. They'll be the ones who learn how to orchestrate intelligence across their business. I have a newsletter coming out about the intelligence economy. Keep an eye out for that. That's the shift that's already happening. That's what Sunshine FM is all about. I am going to leave you with a. With a tune that I ran into the other day. It's not stuff that you normally hear, but I wanted it to show you the power of Sunshine fm. I want to kind of go back to the radio stations of old that had a multiple of genres of music and not be so fragmented like we have been in our playlists and our choice of radio stations. So thanks for listening. Have yourself a fantastic weekend. Hopefully my coding will work this week. This weekend for next week to go automatically. And Sunshine fm Modern media for Palm Springs Coachella SA. Blows me away. That that is AI generated music. See you next week.
