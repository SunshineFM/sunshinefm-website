Hey,

This is Sat. Just poured myself a second glass of wine and honestly? My brain's still buzzing from today's show. You know that feeling when you stumble onto something big but can't quite put your finger on why it matters yet?

## The OpenAI Meltdown Is Actually Fascinating

So OpenAI is hemorrhaging talent because they're morphing from a science lab into a "product factory." And honestly? Good. I'm tired of the AGI mystique bullshit. Jerry Turek, their VP of research, basically said "they won't let me do science anymore" in his goodbye memo. Tom Cunningham was even more brutal - called the company an "informal promotional entity."

But here's what really got me thinking while I was playing that AI-generated song today (which, yes, sounded way too country for what I wanted). OpenAI is slashing funding for Sora and DALL-E because they don't make ChatGPT smarter "right now." They're terrified of losing the crown to Anthropic, and they should be.

Claude 5 might be dropping soon - developers spotted error logs referencing it. Meanwhile, Anthropic is aiming for $26 billion in revenue this year. Twenty-six billion! They're not the scrappy underdog anymore, they're eating OpenAI's enterprise lunch.

You know what this means for us creative types out here in the desert? The product wars are about to get really interesting. And messy.

## The Coding Wars Just Got Real

OpenAI dropped their new native Mac app and got 200,000 downloads in 24 hours. Sounds impressive until you realize Claude Code has 3-4 million daily active users on Mac alone. Ouch.

Sam Altman's pitch is that AI "never gets tired" - like hiring "a team of junior developers who work in parallel." That dopamine hit of constant productivity. But here's the thing - I'm still seeing my developer friends use multiple tools anyway. Cursor, Replit, Claude Code, whatever works for the job.

The real question isn't which tool wins, it's whether we're all just going to end up subscription-hopping between five different coding AIs forever. Because that's where this is heading.

## What We're Really Building Here

Playing that experimental AI track today reminded me why I'm doing this whole thing. We're not just making radio - we're figuring out what media looks like when anyone can generate music, copy, ideas on demand. Most stations will sound exactly the same because they'll all use the same prompts, the same models.

The magic isn't in the AI. It's in knowing what to ask for and having the taste to know when it's working. That country-tinged track I played? Wrong vibe, but the lyrics about '60s protesters behind country club walls? That landed.

We're not trying to replace human creativity. We're trying to figure out how to amplify it without losing what makes it human in the first place.

Talk soon,
Sat
