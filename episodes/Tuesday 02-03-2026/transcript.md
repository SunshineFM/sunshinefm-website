Sa. Well that ending wasn't too bad, was it Wasn't quite what I was looking for in terms of a 70s, laid back kind of social commentary about how the generation who were teenagers basically and young adults in the 60s protesting and now they're behind the country club walls. Country club living. So I thought the lyrics were pretty good. Co written with a couple of my AI co writers. That was the first time I heard that song by the way. Just so you know, Sunshine fm Modern media for Palm Springs Coachella where we're experimenting with AI in real time. If you're listening today, you are experiencing live building with AI and that was an AI generated tune. And the prompt was something along the line of 70s kind of Southern California kind of peaceful, easy style of music. And when you're doing prompts for AI generated music, you also have to put some exclusions in there, you know, so it doesn't sound like certain things that the music services are going to, let's say, revert to. And so I did take away kind of pop, country and modern country, but at the end of the day it ended up sounding a bit more country than I wanted to. I actually have a country artist trio actually. It's. She's called Emmy and her vocals and her harmonies are brilliant. So I've already got a country artist in my. In Sunshine FM records. This one was meant to be a bit more, you know, folk singer songwriter of Southern California. Didn't quite come off. DM me. Let me know what you think. Trust me, this is a safe space. There are no hurt feelings around here. We know we're experimenting with AI and we also know this is demo ready music. It won't make the prime time and the other big plus, this music will not be heard in every other radio station or playlist. It's only on Sunshine FM and obviously some of you are saying yeah, good, but that's okay, some of you aren't. I got some feedback from the conversation and the topics I brought up yesterday. We've got quite a few things going on in the world of AI and so I think a couple of things popped up on one, I think I want to deep dive a little bit into Openclaw and Molt Book. That's M O L T book. If you been listening for the last few days. You know, I've been talking a lot about that because I do, I do sense. It was a sense of where the world is headed but possibly a little too early. When you. When I share the security reports that came up over the last 24 hours. All right, so first of all, first of all, let's do this real quick. As you know, I'm not very good at this. Wonderful little interstitials OR, or station IDing. But no worries, we'll get there. We'll. We'll figure this out together. Where are you? Station id? You're here somewhere, I know that. There we go, right there. Okay, that's too long. There we go. Yes, indeed. Yes, indeed. Yes, indeed. You are listening to Sunshine fm Modern media for Palm Springs, Coachella, all things AI. Okay, so if you're not been paying attention, according to the Hill, there's been a big brain drain@OpenAI Again, if you remembered, earlier on this year, we spoke about OpenAI, the makers of Chat GPT calling a code red in December. Well, I think this is just some of that continuation. Now, having said that, there is a little kind of nuance to this. The scoop basically is OpenAI is bleeding top talent because they are morphing from a science lab into a product factory. The pure research era is over. The Cell ChatGPT era is here. According to reporters at the Hill. A key departure. Jerry Turek. He's a seven year veteran and VP of research. He didn't just leave, he posted a memo saying he's leaving to explore research that is now, in his words, hard to do at OpenAI. Basically a polite way of saying, they won't let me do science anymore. The other person leaving is economist Tom Cunningham, who left in September with a scorching goodbye note. He said he was tired of the tension between doing rigorous work and serving as an, his words, informal promotional entity for the company. Ooh, ouch. And here's where some of the casualties are as far as we are concerned as creatives and developers and tech startup founders in the Coachella Valley. The teams behind Sora, which if you remember is the AI generated video, and let's call it what it is, their attempt at a social network and Dall? E, that's D A L L E, that's the image generator for OpenAI. They're basically reporting that their funding is being slashed or denied open air. OpenAI is telling them if it doesn't make ChatGPT smarter right now, we don't want to pay for it. Yikes. Now that's what's happening. According to the Hill, as of the last 24 hours, there's another kind of scoop behind the scenes, or I should say that complements this story. It's been happening anyway for the last six months, but it also started surfacing over the last 24 hours. And that is Anthropic has not only like come up from the back to not just kind of lead, as it were, in the air race, but it feels like they might be taking over ChatGPT, at least in certain domains and industries where they're making a lot of money. Right. And why is it news today? Well, and this is rumor, it was. I'll tell you where it came from, but the rumor is Claude 5 is imminent. And if that's the case, OpenAI might be terrified of losing the smartest model crown. And where that leak came from was developers spotted error logs on Google's Vertex AI platform referencing Claude Sonnet 5 as of February 3, 2026. That was according to a forum post on Reddit. Anthropic basically is not the scrappy underdog anymore. We know that they are aiming for $26 billion in revenue this year. And we also know that they eating into OpenAI's Enterprise lunch, which is why Sam Altman pushed Code Red in December. In January, sorry, in December, generally. And now he's pushing a sort of Code Red now on shipping products instead of writing papers. And if you're in the AI world, you know exactly what that means. If you're not necessarily the explain like I'm five is basically this. AI companies who have been around for many, many years, some of them over a decade old, their goal is AGI. And AGI, well, again, coming from a layman, is the holy grail of research upon research to get to a place where the AI is smarter than every human living on the planet, in every domain, in every subject since ChatGPT came out in November of 2022. Yes, there's been lots of overtures and conversations about they're racing towards AGI. But what's happened over the last six months, maybe last nine months is okay. Where is the money going to come from? And so a lot of the AI companies have kind of pivoted to monetization. And because OpenAI is looking to go public later this year at a valuation of mostly like a trillion dollars, I think they're making the tough decision on putting a lot more resources, which is money and talent. And Sam Altman has to make the decision we need to focus on the monetization. The monetization comes from creating products that we consumers will end up paying for. So I think that's what's happening. Bigger picture. And so what does it mean for us in the, in the Coachella Valley, in the Palm Springs, Coachella region. Well, in a way, the product wars are generally good for consumers because, you know, they're fighting for our attention, they're fighting for our dollars. So perhaps the services might get less expensive. It also means that they're going to be competing with each other to come out with the best product, the best agent. And so if they come out with tools that get better and better at coding, then that's great for us as, as entrepreneurs. Right. And while most, I'd say, you know, non developers, non AI bubble dwellers like us tend to just use ChatGPT or maybe Google Gemini, I think what might start happening and start kind of leak out broader into the mainstream is they're going to start, a lot of people are going to start doing what we're doing, which is we're going to use multiple models for everything anyway. So what I do here at Sunshine fm, creating a modern media from scratch, creating a radio station from scratch requires a lot of different skill sets and a lot of different talent, as it were. And that's not going to come from one model. It's going to come from a variety of AI tools and services and models. I think the, if you're a creative and I have a ton of friends in from Hollywood, you know, the experimental tools like Sora being deprioritized, that may not be such a good thing. But at the end of the day, they did make a big deal with Disney. So I think the social network aspect of Sora is still there. They may not be pushing the envelope on making Sora even better or the image. Right. We already have Nano Banana Pro from Google Gemini, which is fantastic. And there's a ton of AI video services out there from Runway and Mid Journey and, and others that are still going to push the envelope. Mark Chen, OpenAI chief research officer, he was quoted as saying combining research with real world deployment strengthens the company science. Okay. I mean, I know what he's trying to say there, but thank you very much. Mark. You've got a tough job, but at the end of the day, you are part of OpenAI and you're going to go public later this year. Congratulations, Sam. Okay. By the way, I am putting together a MIDI board to help me with the transitions more than likely this weekend. So stick around. Okay. That basically means we're switching to another story. This next story comes to us from, well, I got it from perplexity, but Perplexity, as you know, does aggregate a ton of research from a ton of different resources. Okay, here we go. This is where it's from. It's From D dev graphic 1. And the conversation is talking about OpenAI. They have to compete with Claude code, right? They've had Codex up on their web browser for quite some time and they released their new Mac OS native codecs app and it had 200,000 downloads in 24 hours. I was not one of them, did not know about it until this morning. But I will be downloading that later on this week and experiment with it. But keep this in mind. 200000 downloads in 24 hours is a big deal, but open AI actually right now is playing catch up because if you look at the king of the hill right now, it's anthropic. Anthropic are the makers of Claude code. We talk about Claude code here constantly because it's one of the models I not only use, but I use Claude code. Mac OS native app. And that tool right now is printing money. It's basically bringing in about a billion dollars in revenue. While there aren't official download numbers, insiders are estimated that they have about 3 to 4 million daily active users on Mac, and that's on Mac alone that I'm counted as one of those. So OpenAI 200,000 downloads is a great start, but there's still just a small spec in Claude's rear view mirror. And it's not just those two. You've also heard me talking about Google's foray into native apps for their coding AI and their one is called Anti Gravity, which they released last November. We don't actually have official numbers for this, but an enterprise tool like this should be at about 800,000 users by now. Three months. So it'll be interesting to see where Open Air and Codex native apps, what number they get to in three months time, which is basically around May, right, right around my birthday, if you're keeping track. 200,000 is great. One day. It really comes down to how good this is. It's, you know, early, early research into Reddit forums and hacker news shows that it's pretty strong. And while I have have my own kind of personal favorites between Claude Code and Anti Gravity, it'll be interesting to see what, where Codex falls in. Now, having said that, if you came to any of our AICV workshops that we did at Cal State University San Bernardino all last summer and last fall at the ERC center, which is underwritten by the city of Palm Desert, you'll remember that we did a lot of training about how you can go ahead and actually use some coding tools. AI coding Tools such as Cursor or Replit and even others like Lovable and Bolt. So where does this news leave those indie like Favorites? Cursor hit 1 million users recently, which is a massive milestone for a startup. And while they're being squeezed by the giants, you know, if you're a developer, ask yourself, are you moving over to Cloud Code or Anti Gravity or are you staying with Cursor? If you. Either way, DM me, let me know. You can go to Sunshine fm. You can reach me there. Let me know. I'd love to know what you're doing locally. I know when I talk to my developers and engineers in town, they're using a variety of all of them, but Cursor still tends to be a very like a big favorite of theirs. And then Replit, oh my God. Replit Globally is like 22 million users. Replit's a bit, I wouldn't say easier to use, but it is aimed more at folks who are just jumping into coding. Right. That's why it's kind of generally they've made some great deals with universities because they are one of the choices for beginners and students. And so OpenAI is not necessarily coming for students with the Codex. They're coming for the pros who are using Cursor and Claude. And I think that's where the competition will lie. And you have a quote here from Sam Altman. The CEO of OpenAI basically says the dopamine is the AI never gets tired, even though developers get tired of switching between five different apps to get the job done. He believes that the dopamine that you're going to feel from using Codex is going to help help you stay on Codex. He also likened it to hiring a team of junior developers who all work in parallel on different parts of your project, rather than one guy doing one thing at a time. Wow, that's pretty good. He says the models just don't run out of dopamine. They just don't get tired. They just don't lose motivation. They just keep coding. Nice one, Sam. Well, here's the thing. If you are using coding tools or coding agents, which is next step up. There is something to be said about that. It just comes down to how you're setting them up, right? Yes, you are. Yes you are. Yes you are. Sunshine fm, Modern Media, Palm Springs, Coachella. Okay, there's a startup. And here's the other good news. Los Angeles based a startup. When was the last time you heard about a startup out of LA doing something in AI? Here's a Startup launched out of la backed by some of the biggest names in tech. They're calling it an operating system for agents. And when I say agents, I'm talking about real estate agents. Why I think this is great news and why I haven't broken other news about other AI services that are aimed at, let's say, brokers and real estate agents. They are doing something that when I share it with you, you're going to think is a no brainer. But it's the first time I'm hearing anybody doing this from an AI point of view and it's pretty remarkable and pretty brilliant. And so let me share the news with you and then I'll let what I'll, I'll give my AI strategic, put my AI strategy hat on and let you know why I think it's so important for our local area. Okay. I mean this is pretty, pretty brilliant. It's basically, oh, by the way, you can DM me and I'll be happy to share with you the founders so you can go right to them and see if you can get a demo or something. Okay. It's shifting the focus of all software products that you have out there and even a handful of AI startups that are, let's say, taking on incumbents using AI intelligence from managing current data, which is what a property is, to revealing future potential, what a property could be. That's why I use the term operating system for agents. And when I tell you what it does, you are going to die. Well, maybe not die, but it's going to be pretty brilliant. Here's, here's what I want you to think out. If you're a real estate agent right now or a local broker in the Coachella Valley, and if you're a buyer, you're basically buying a, let's say a mid century home in Palm Springs or a lot in Rancho Mirage, your agent currently can tell you what the house costs, they can tell you comps, it can tell you why it's a good deal or why you should consider buying it and if it fits your purposes, et cetera, et cetera. But if you ask that real estate agent, can I build a casita or can I expand the master suite? Their normal answer, which by the way, it's not this, this is not their kind of, you know, domain expertise. But they will normally say, oh, you know what, let me find out. Let's, let's call a city, let me get a surveyor, let me talk to somebody in my team. And while if you've got a really good Relationship with a realtor, that may not be a deal killer. If you start using this AI companies, this AI startups solutions, what it can do is basically. It can answer that question for you using AI intelligence. There has a, it has a new feature in there that is, that's called underbuilt. And what it does, it instantly scans zoning laws and setbacks and a variety of other determining factors. And obviously there's, this is the worst it's going to be. It's going to get better and better as more and more data comes on into the AI brain within it and it shows you the property's hidden potential on the spot. It doesn't just show you the house, it shows you the future of the house. Boom. I tell you, if I had a little zinger on my keypad here, I would do it. I don't, I mean this is so powerful, let me tell you. I mean I know this firsthand. I got friends in Los Angeles, they bought a house in LA and it took them forever, well not forever, but at least six months to try and figure out if the ADU in the backyard, if they could extend it, expand it, go two story etc and six months later they found out the right answer. Can you imagine, can you imagine if we were looking for a lot in Movie Colony or in up in up 74 in Palm Desert? And you can, your agent can instantly only show you properties that have already that an ADU could fit legally. I mean yes, I think we can do that now, but it takes so much effort and it takes a lot of time. As my example for my friends in LA out here, if you asked an agent show me properties only where ADUs fit legally, not just an intuition, but a real. I think you'd be hard pressed to get a find those properties period. And for renovations, can you imagine all these 1960s 70s homes that need updates? An agent with this tool in his or her belt can verify if you can legally expand the footprint before you even make an offer. And imagine land values, it helps justify higher prices for tear downs by proving the buildable square footage immediately. How powerful is that? So here's the takeaway. This helps agents move from just selling homes to becoming investment advisors. Actually a previous line I had was it helps agents move from just selling homes to becoming property developers. I mean, is it just me or am I just kind of giddy at the idea of AI intelligence turning this. Let's just, let's call it what it is. Just a. Every agent is pretty much doing the same thing as every Other agent. This would be such a great USP from all the other agents in town. So in a market like ours, where inventory is kind of tight, I don't think prices are rebounding. They're kind of staying flat. If you can show a client hidden value, oh, my goodness, what a win. And the agents who use this will look like geniuses, and the ones who don't will look like. Well, what they look like. Right now, they're just guessing. DM me at Sunshine fm, if you want to know the name of the fabulous startup, I'll be happy to introduce you to the. To the founders. Okay, You're listening to Sunshine fm, Modern Media for Palm Springs Coachella. You're listening to Sunshine fm, Modern Media for Palm Springs Coachella. Okay, that was two of them in a row. No worries. That's okay. You know what radio station you're listening to, right? All right, so if you were at our workshops last year or if you've been listening to the radio station for the last few weeks, you'll know I spoke about a couple of companies called Manus and genspark. Quick, hands up. Who remembers Manus or genspark? Nobody out there. Okay, fair enough. Here's the question I'm going to have for you. If you're an owner of a small business, but your website is, let's just say, a little on the old side, you haven't touched, you haven't given any TLC lately because you either have a marketing agency looking after it or a local webmaster, but because it's good enough, you've not necessarily played around with that website. And if you, obviously, whatever work you do, a lot of your traffic is coming from digital sources. And even your digital sources, they need a place to land. Used to be the telephone, now it's websites, your digital presence. Right. Here's a new company, it's called Gen Store, another startup from la. You go la. What they're claiming is the following. And by the way, may sound repetitive, but just bear with me. I'll tell you where the secret is. Okay, they. They claiming that you can build a fully working online store in just two minutes and then raise $10 million to make this happen. By the way, the other company also raised $10 million from some pretty savvy investors. I'm not sure the investors are on this one, but they just raised $10 million too. I'm trying to figure out who are the. What was the. Who were the references? Who were the. Okay, this was on Globe News Wire. Oh, you know, it's a PR release. I apologize. Finance Yahoo. Well, they're real. But you know, even Retail Innovation Hub had it on their newsletter. It basically it's a platform that deploys a coordinated team of specialized AA AI agents. Yeah, sure, you mean Autonomous Automations. It has a design agent for layout and branding, a product agent for generating listings and imagery, and a launch agent for SEO and compliance. Oh, and an analytics agent for conversion insights. I say all this because when you throw up a website and you want to do it really well, you do need those four disciplines to really make a website sing. You as a user of Gen Store, you describe your business idea through natural language. So if English is your primary language, you describe your business idea through prompting. And Gen Store AI analyzes your product data, the market signals out there, the design, design patterns that might be either working for other folks in your field or let's say ones that may not be as utilized as they could be. And it generates a ready to sell storefront. Henwei Huang, who's the co founder and president of Gen Store previously who worked at intel and Google, says that most e commerce founders don't fail because they lack ideas. They fail because they're forced to operate alone. This way, Gen Store automates the operational grind so founders can lead with vision. And if you're a tech person like I am, you will know a platform called Product Hunt and it was ProductHunt's product of the day a couple of months back before they raised all this money. So obviously investors have seen something pretty exciting in this, right? If you're hearing some noise in the background, those are my gardeners come to clean up around the home based radio station Sunshine fm Modern Media, Palm Springs, Coachella. All right, look, I'm a Google local expert and what that really means is I, I can go ahead and make edits, I can go ahead and talk about local businesses in Google Maps and in Google my business, right? And while it's not as, it's not as powerful as you think it is in terms of my power, one of the, one of the things that they tend to be somewhat, I wouldn't say it's friction, it's just that most people don't even take the time, right? If I see a business on Google Maps that is closed or has moved or is changed to another business or sometimes on the Maps it has its location like in the wrong building in the same kind of commercial area. So I'll go ahead and move it, put the edit and say I believe this in the wrong place. It should Be over here. It goes to their vetters and the vets and the vet and the moderators. After, you know, within 24 hours, usually less. They'll say, hey, great, good edit. We'll go ahead and update the. The map. Right. Well, apparently Google right now using Google Gemini is, is coming out with a chatbot solution to this. And it's mostly a kind of a receptionist. So you'll chat to the chatbot on Google Maps and have questions about that business generally to make Google Search and Google Maps obviously more accurate. And while it doesn't take away behind the scenes what they normally do, it does take away from me having to like, open up a form, fill in the information, and send it back to Google this way. I think the goal is just to chat with the chatbot to say, oi, this coffee shop around the corner is no longer there. I think it's kind of cool. I think we might get a lot more people helping our maps and our search and be a bit more accurate, a bit more timely. And what we're seeing in the code, according to one of the developers, is it takes your note like, hey, this place is closed on Sundays these days and it files the paperwork for you. Okay, fair enough. Okay, I did not know that. But anyway, anything to make my job on this side of the app easier. They're basically just doing what I would normally do or a local Google Guide. Local guide would do, which is we're seeing something in real life, we're passing it on to Google Gemini, and they're taking care of it. Less friction, basically, is what it comes down to. All right, thank you. You are listening to Sunshine FM Modern Media for Palm Springs. Coach Chill, Sunshine. Oh, yeah, that one worked. Okay, so I've got a couple more stories. I wonder if I have enough. Oh, yeah, I've got this story. This is a good one. Okay, this is funny because every time I talk to hospitality operators out here in the Coachella Valley and when I talk to folks who are in the larger tourism agencies and organizations in town and even the hospitality departments at the universities, they don't necessarily seem too concerned about AI. Yeah, they, you know, they're kind of folding it in here and there. But when I talk to them, number one, you know, by the way, this is going back two years too, right? They don't seem too concerned because their general say defense is, look, you still need somebody. You still need a human to take the food from the kitchen to the diner. They're not wrong there. You still need somebody to pull up a car from valet. You still need somebody to housekeep the rooms. You still need somebody, a human, to make all the food, prep all the drinks, etc. Etc. And they're not necessarily wrong there, right? We know we're a valley full of hospitality and tourism and that service economy is pretty big for us. And while there have been plenty of little robotic experiments happening through the years at McDonald's and at some hotel chains and stuff, of very little has actually kind of made the mainstream. Now, having said that, there's two things I want to bring to your attention. Number one, do you remember the times when you used to go to a hotel and there was a concierge desk or a concierge area? And there was two or three concierge that would say hello and would share maps with you or show directions or make reservations for you? Maybe it's the hotels I'm going to, but they've been long gone. Replaced by apps. Each hotel has their own app and you have a digital receptionist. Digital check in. Digital concierge. Now sometimes, yeah, I guess it makes sense. I don't need to say hello to a receptionist. But when it comes to concierge folks that know the area, I don't know about you, but you want to talk to a human generally anyway. They've been gone for decades, right? Maybe a decade at the most, but they're slowly fading away. So it is happening. It's just happening. Not as urgently as AI is accelerating through the world. Well, get this, Starbucks is coming out with a robot arm. Not an entire humanoid robot, but basically a robot arm. And it's exactly what you think it is. Starbucks is deploying AI voice assistance in the drive thru. And we're not talking about those glitchy auto attendants that we currently have. In some drive thrus. The system filters out noises around you, ignores the kids in the back yelling, and it handles the order. So the human at the window just hands you your coffee drink. According to LinkedIn, it says it doesn't call in sick, it doesn't have a bad attitude, and it never forgets to upsell. Okay, that's kind of cool. Fact number two, this Siren system is basically a bartender robot. Okay? So they've installed the new automated equipment called the siren system. It dispenses ice and milk and blends drinks automatically. It cuts the time to make a frappuccino from 90 seconds down to 30 seconds. That's a massive labor reduction. You don't need a person scooping ice anymore. Now, does that mean the drive thru Lanes are going to go by faster or does that mean the person inside Starbucks loses their job? I think for the time being, the short term the drive throughs is just going to get faster. And in the back of the house they're using AI scanning tools to count cups and coffee beans. Basically says, according to the BBC, no more manager with a clipboard spending two hours doing inventory on a Sunday night. The machine does it. Let me tell you, I wish when I was general manager of various restaurants and resorts I had that tool. Because let me tell you, if you own a restaurant right now, inventory at the end of the month, come on, it's the worst. You don't want to do it, none of your stomp want to do it. And you end up doing it when the place closes and you're doing it all the way until 2 or 3 o' clock in the morning. And if you don't have a good system in place. Yep, it's just clipboards and you know, we humans, we tend to make mistakes, a lot of them. So I love the idea of an inventory manager with a camera. Now those are just three examples of what Starbucks is rolling out with. Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol says this is all about removing friction so baristas can connect with you. Have you been to a Starbucks lately? I mean inside, not the drive thru there are they are actually writing your name on the action. No, they're not. They're basically just saying have a good day. The name is still just basically a sticker. Okay, they're getting there. They're being nice. I think while I love this as a consumer and if I was a manager of a, let's say a coffee shop or retail outlet or even a restaurant, I would love this right now. If I'm a front level, frontline employee, not only will I have to learn to work with my digital co workers, right now it's just an arm and a camera and an ice scooper. I think the trajectory, at least the demos I've seen over the last year or so is as they get better, there will be unless there's more demand in the valley, meaning more tourists coming in or more people relocating and we all have more money to spend. Unless that demand goes up, I think there is going to be less and less need for a workforce as things get automated, which they have done for the last 20 years. And if AI continues its current trajectory, it's just a matter of time now. I'm not judging this one way or the other. I'm just saying this is where I See the trend, happy to be proven wrong and hopefully there's major abundance of for all of us across the board. If you're working at any of these places or if you've experienced, let's say some sort of AI agentic drive thru order or a gentic humanoid robotic arm here in the Valley, let me know where it is, I'd like to go visit. I'm not necessarily seen any except in some drive throughs. When you, when you hear them you can, you can tell that it's mostly an AI order taker. But if you, whatever your experience is, DM me, get a hold of me at Sunshine FM and get on the show. Let's talk about this. If you're a manager or an owner of one of these outlets, let's talk about it. Pros and cons, I think. But at the end of the day, frictionless service is kind of what we're looking for, right? In a way. All right. I wonder if I want to get down to that. Really. Okay, here's a quick little one. Quick hands up. Who knows what Copilot is by Microsoft? Anybody? Anybody out there? Microsoft 365 copilot, anybody? No? Okay, I'm going to share this with you because it just kind of staggering in terms of the uptake. We all know that Microsoft is in like almost everybody's computer. It has like 450 million commercial seats. That's a ton of money. And so when they had, they, they've basically had open air because they're a large, they're like 30% owners of OpenAI and they've had OpenAI's chat GPT since day one. When I go around the valley and ask folks who use Microsoft, are you using Copilot? They generally just kind of shrug and say yes, it's there. Yes, it's being, you know, yes, my company's bought seats and we have to use it. I also have a bunch, a handful of Microsoft remote workers in town who I love, I love that they're here and I love that they come to our workshops. But you know, and they are, they are great ambassadors for Microsoft and Copilot. But the number that blew me away yesterday for Microsoft's earnings report was the amount from that 450 million commercial seats. How many were actually paying for Copilot? Take a guess. Go ahead, put your hand up and I'll be calling on you. Okay, you, how about you? What do you think? All right, 3.3%. Let that sink in. 3% out of 450 million users are paying for Copilot. Oh, who knows? Maybe Satya Nadella is very happy with that and it is right in line with what he wants. But from, from the outside, first of all, I've played around with Copilot. They got a lot of work to do. 3%. What are you paying for? Those are good salespeople, if you ask me. You are listening to sunshine fm. Modern media for palm springs coachella. Yep. You know what? You're listening to Sunshine fm, Modern Media, Palm Springs Coachella. All right, so I'll finish with this. You've been hearing me talk for the last couple of weeks about OpenClaw, the open source, locally hosted AI agent that takes over your computer and let you allow it to run your life. Yes, that's the future. And then about a week after that came out, some gentleman, some guy who runs Octane AI, I think his. Matt, his name's Matt Schlitt, he thought, wow, wouldn't it be great if these autonomy. These agents that have autonomy. What if they had a social network that was only for them and that they could go in and, you know, have conversations with each other and learn from each other? Great idea. You put it out there. It went from a thousand agents to 10,000 agents to 100,000 agents. And by last Saturday, the number on their dashboard was 1.5 million agents were on their social network. And their social network, if you want to look it up, is Malt Book. M O L T Book. If you heard me last week and yesterday's show, still talking about it. Still want to play around with it. I hadn't picked up my Mac mini M4 yet because it's on a backorder, because it's a custom build and takes about two weeks to get the configuration I'm looking for to run Sunshine fm. And perhaps it's just as well because over the last couple of days. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Some of these security experts came out and basically said, what are you doing? And how are a whole bunch of security attack vectors. When you go to Malt Book? Not. Not the open source openclaw, but Malt Book. And make sure you spell it M O L T Book. If you do Malt Book, which is what the AI transcription services come back with, you're going to find a whiskey tasting club, which, as my AI agent says, which honestly, you might need after hearing the security report. That's hilarious. Okay, fair enough. All right. It was a revolutionary social network for AIs. Turns out it's a ghost town populated by bots. Scamming other bots. Nagli, the researcher that I trust, found that one single agent spun up half a million accounts. Whoa. That's not a community. That's a denial of service attack waiting to happen. And the scariest part? The supply chain. We found a user named hightower6eu who uploaded over 300 fake crypto trading skills to the Open Claw library. You download one thinking you're getting rich, and boom, your entire machine belongs to them. That was according to Cyber Press. So if you're running this stuff at home like I was planning on, but, you know, you know, we'll see where that goes. I guess the advice right now is disconnect it from your primary machine. Treat it like radioactive material be. Because right now, the only thing these agents are effectively automating is your own identity theft. That's. That's too bad. I'll keep you posted with a lot more information, a lot more news about Openclaw and maltbook. I think OpenClaw is here to stay. Malt book. It might be a great kind of signal for us, but make no mistake, social networks for AI agents with autonomy. It's going to happen at some point. I'm going to leave you today with a very cool. Well, I think all my songs are pretty cool, right? All co. Created by my AI co writers. I want to leave it with two of them. One, the original version of. Easy, peaceful feeling, sort of 70s kind of singer. He sings about the Lament. The lyrics aren't perfect, but the. The tune is pretty good. And at the end, I'm going to leave you with a fantastic little swing number called Quiet in the Hangar. It's basically about ladies who are now who served in the 40s at the. With the forces in World War II. And now when they go to Palm Springs Air Museum, they see all these memories and reminders of their sacrifice. And the song is called Quiet in the Hangar. I'll play that one first. Sunshine FM Modern Media for Palm Springs Coachella. Stay tuned. You can reach me at Sunshine fm. Have yourselves a fantastic day. We'll talk tomorrow.
