It. That was Ronnie. That was like an extended mix that we wanted to play around with for one of her songs. So let me run a couple of station jingles real quick. Okay? Okay. I don't know why, but those always make me smile. So what you got? There was a. A selection of various, let's say, station IDs, songs that. I think this is what's so exciting about this experiment that we're doing at Sunshine fm. So let's enough of that for now. It is Monday, January 19th, and you are listening to Sunshine FM, Modern Media for Palm Springs Coachella. Yep, this is all just a big, giant experiment, but an experiment with a purpose. My name is Sat. I'm the radio station manager of Sunshine fm. And while there's variety of goals, the main purpose is I would, I think, if I had to, like, put it out there. It's basically to see what the opportunity is and the possibilities are about around AI. Now, we've been talking about AI for the last three years. Can you believe that chat? GPT was released just over three years ago. And by now, I'm sure if you're listening to this, you're already playing around with it and experimenting and putting this into your workflow. For three years, we've been kind of basically humming and hawing about what AI is going to do for us. Now, I happen to believe it is going to be the new interface for how we access Internet and everything that stands for, but there's obviously going to be fits and starts, and obviously there's going to be folks further up the journey and folks just barely getting introduced to it. Sunshine FM is hopefully going to be a safe space. Actually, not hopefully. It is a safe space for anybody that's interested, curious, has imagination, has ideas, has pushback. I mean, maybe you've got concerns. That's okay. This is a place to have those common conversations. This is not polished podcast. This is not professional radio. This is an experiment. One human augmented with an army of AI agents, by the way, used a variety of foundational models and a variety of different services, all of them just experimental. There are no manuals, as it were. There are no onboarding guides. Well, there are. They're just all over the place. And so what I tend to do is just jump in and play around with it. This radio station is that experiment live we're building in public. And I need your help. And what I mean by need your help is you got something to say, you've got ideas, come on, reach out to me. Just DM me. You Know how to get a hold of me coming live to you from Palm Springs Coachella every weekday for the rest of the year. We will see what happens. So one of the agents that I've built goes out into the interwebs and double checks, confirms, fact checks, verifies the information that I listen to on a daily basis. Now, if you're like me, you, you get information through podcasts. That's primarily where I get most of my information. Newsletters. We, if you're like me, you subscribe to maybe 100 or more newsletters and you just don't have time to read them all. And conversations out on the street. I, we. You know, last year I ran over 30 AI workshops out of Cal State University, San Bernardino, the Palm Desert campus. And so there's a lot of conversations I have with leadership organizations, academies, business people, founders, and all of that information that I consume helps shape how I think of AI and specifically for Palm Screens Coachella, how I think about the startup ecosystem that is or isn't here, fits and starts, etc. Etc. But then I also realized last year that there's a ton of information around AI and technology and the world that we're kind of heading into that no single person can actually keep up with it. That's why we created aicv, AI Coachella Valley. And even someone like myself who takes all this information, it almost feels like it kind of lives within me. And just the handful of people, or in last year's case, 350 people that I ran into doing at the workshops, at the presentations and the, the meetups that we put together. And I just feel like that's just not enough. Right. It's going to take more than 350 people to really move the needle if we, as Palm Springs Coachella, are to embrace what this future might hold for us. And we, and if we are to really create a truly startup ecosystem with, let's just say these new technologies at the core, are we teaching this to the kids? Are we teaching this to entrepreneurs? Are we teaching this to the small businesses? I think we should. I think there's people out there trying to do their best, but it's siloed. Just like we in the, in the Palm Springs Coachella region. We're made up of nine cities and adjacent. It seems to me everybody works silos. This is my attempt to try and all come together and try and speak with each other and help each other embrace, especially as we try and embrace how AI is going to affect everything that we do in our Personal and professional lives. Anyway, that's a record that you're going to hear me play over and over again. You have about 250 days of this for the rest of the year. Okay. Okay. I'm laughing because that seems pretty monumental. But I also know how quickly the years just passed by. It feels like only yesterday that we started our workshops at Cal State and 2025 has disappeared. And while I'd love to say I moved the needle, I don't think we really did move the needle. But that's for another. That's for another show. Okay. And by the way, just so we're on the same page, this is not meant to be criticism. I know that incentives need to be aligned for things to happen. But I do want to hopefully have Sunshine FM be a safe space where we can have these conversations and hopefully conversations and ideas turning to actions. All right, so the format for Sunshine FM, some music, some generated ad jingles, some station IDs, you got a little feel for that at the top of the hour. And then we go into kind of the, the meat of the, the show, which is also separated into three different portions. It's called the signal, local intelligence, and then community notes. Now, for the time being, until I can get a lot more content and a lot more listeners and a lot more folks to come on and have this conversation, they're all going to be kind of mixed together. Signal how it, you know, what's happening in the AI world generally in the last 24 hours and what it means for us in Palm Springs, Coachella. The local intelligence is mixed in there. I am betting on some of my fellow entrepreneurs and founders and AI experimenters to come on the air and let's have conversations about how they may be using it and how they're also integrating this in their clients workflows. And then community notes. Just a whole bunch of notes I take, you know, all week long from folks that will meet up for coffee, meet up at various events, and I put them down, then hopefully we'll answer some of those questions or some of those thoughts that people have. So I did, one of my agents that I built did go out and come back with some stories for the last, you know, on Monday show. It's basically from, you know, Saturday, Sunday and Monday. So it's just, this is like a three day version. I'm not sure about you, but if you were over the holidays, Claude Code was a huge, big kind of sensation. Everybody was like basically trying to code apps and websites and let's say software, personal Software using Claude code. It was a lot of fun. I mean I was always one of them. I was playing around with it too. It's also one of the foundational models that I tend to use right here at Sunshine fm. And because we're building in public, a lot of these experiments are not going to go quite as well as we first thought of them right then. I am no exception. While Claude code helped me actually code as a non developer by the way, actually put together thousands of lines of code in my terminal on my Mac, which I thought was fascinating and brilliant at the same time. It also broke a lot of these Python scripts that it wrote. When it went to actual production, as it were on Friday show, it broke, didn't quite work out the way I wanted. So I spent the weekend re vising, rejiggering the code again. You know, you spend enough hours and you start having more respect for actual software engineers and coders because there's a, there's a lot more to this than someone like me, who is mostly a idea person and brand strategist. I've always had in my teams in tech startups, I've always had the highest amount of respect for our engineers. They just have their own language, they also have their own attitude. And I was hoping that with AI, we who aren't as technical would be able to at least be able to speak their language. I didn't realize there was such a translation to be had. As a product manager, it's definitely something that if you have a good software engineer on your team, treat that, treat her with a lot of respect. Now having said that, I also do believe that AI is going to make somewhat, make that bridge somewhat shorter as it were. The translation, the conversation, some empathy goes both ways. Right now it tends to be going towards the coders and what I mean by that it's if you were using Claude code before last week, you're mostly using it in the terminal. If you're using it this week Claude Cowork was released. What is Claude Coworker? Well, anthropic. The makers of Claude Cowork is extending agentic capabilities beyond coding into the general knowledge work. What I mean by that is in your documents, your folders, your structured outputs, your permissions and it's shipping fast because they realize that while the holidays people were playing around with Claude code in the terminal, they also realized most new people, if they're going to expand the PI, which they need to, obviously for business sake, they need to get a lot more non coders involved and Claude code. Actually Claude Cowork is that answer was just released last week. I'm having a bit of fun with basically tries gets you out of the terminal and using coding language and puts you into a chat bot interface using natural language. And I think it's pretty powerful. There's obviously there's going to be a ton of bugs in this and I'm already run into a few of them. But if you haven't played around with Claude Cowork, I do think it's important because it's not necessarily about the intelligence part, it's about replacing the work you need to get done while you can focus on hopefully more of your human work. So when I say replacing work, I'm not talking about replacing humans or replacing jobs. I'm talking about replacing the work that you have to do on a daily basis. Okay. It's now rolling out to more users, which was great because prior to actually just a couple of days ago, it was only for max users, which is 100 or 200amonth. It's now rolling out in the beta version because there are lots of bugs in this to pro users and that's 20 bucks a month. So this is pretty fantastic. This is a philosophical shift. The one my agent presented it this way. Chatbots, assist agents, substitute. That's maybe that's something that's tweet worthy, but you still have to explain it. And the explanation could be it's somewhat impressive because it touches real work, it does enforce boundaries and it produces outputs shaped for downstream use, which. Which is exactly how enterprises think. And it's also mirroring what we're seeing everywhere else. AI is moving from answering questions to owning steps in the process, which is what our workshops were all about last last year, which we, we knew that we're moving from just an answer engine, which it's still going to be have millions of users, this is chatbots or AI in general, will have millions of users just to answer questions. This year it's going to be about creating workflows, work processes, and if you're using Claude code like in the cowork sense, this can help you own those steps. So the takeaway this early is possibly a mainstream AI product that actually feels like it could replace part of our workflow without the fits and starts that we experienced all last year. And as I mentioned earlier, this is not about replacing jobs, it's about helping you with those tasks that make up your job. Right. Again, these are very early days, very brittle. Even though those of us in the AI bubble have been playing around with this, something along these lines for three years. And even last year was meant to be the year of the agent. Which, you know, if you've seen the ads, Salesforce, even Gemini, even Claude, they, they'd started spending money on ads late last year. The promise of agents was purely that mostly a promise. I know for a fact that most of the enterprises and clients that I work with, a lot of their early experiments in 2024 have been abandoned in 2025, and they're kind of going back to what I've been. One of my workshops is ChatGPT mastery. And what we found over the last year and a half is the technical tools are mostly there for what you need for your, your business. The real bottleneck is cultural meaning. Humans at different levels in different departments, at different, let's say, point of view about AI and different security feelings and feelings of, you know, let's say fear. All of that culture of your organization needs to be aligned whichever way you decide to do this. Aligned on what, what the business is trying to do moving forward. That's what we learned last over the last 18 months. That's a workshop that I lead for enterprises. And I think after the holidays, coming into 2026, this is where that hopefully the, the real promise happens because it's moving away from hype and into actually what workflows can we utilize AI and how can we make sure that security departments, their fears are listened to? Because security is going to be very important, obviously within a enterprise. And these agents this year, I think are going to have rails, guardrails to help protect what you want, what your business is. It's not, you know, let's not lose sight of the fact that prompt injection and leakage are still unsolved. So that is still a big issue. That's why I'm always saying play in a little sandbox, not the entire database of your, your information. And again, I don't think 2026 is going to be much different from 2025 in terms of adoption. I still think the adoption is going to be uneven. But where I do see some acceleration, the folks who are actually moving from ideas and thoughts and words to actual action, I think the folks who are putting this in action, even if in some sort of experimentation, they are going to go much, much faster in 2026 than those who are still stuck in the boardroom, still stuck at meetups and events talking about this stuff, but not really doing much when they go back to their businesses or their enterprises. So I do think this is where AI is going, period. I do think the adoption will be absolutely uneven. And so if you have any experiments that you're running or any inter integrations that you already put in place in your business, small business, mid business or large enterprise, and you want to talk about this, just DM me, reach out to me and we'll get you on the show one of these days. Signal number two, well, if you're in the air bubble, this is not news to you. If you're not, I'm here to tell you that the models are slowly becoming interchangeable and the real USP or moat is orchestration. And what do I mean by models again? Your major models such as the one that you all know about, ChatGPT, Google, Gemini, Claude, Anthropic. Claude by Anthropic. There's a few others too. Mistral from Europe, Xai from well basically Twitter, X, Amazon is working on theirs. Microsoft has a combination of theirs, Copilot you may have heard of and many more. But the foundational Big seven, they're becoming interchangeable. And so that's good news in a way because now we can experiment with a whole bunch of different, let's say foundational models. But it's not so good news if you're enterprise because you have to pick one or the other. Well, maybe you don't have to pick one or the other. I'm having conversations when I'm in these meetings that they feel paralyzed because they feel as though they have to pick one and because they don't know who's in the lead or which is going to be the best, which one's still going to be around in a, you know, five years from now, they're paralyzed and so they don't move at all with any of them. That's a separate story. So here's what we're seeing. Things like Cursor is building massive code bases autonomously. Replit is letting people build and deploy apps instantly. And as I just mentioned, because enterprises either are not moving because they don't know which model to pick, they're basically adopting multi model strategies to manage not just cost, but risk. And the developers I speak to, they're doing what I'm doing, which is we're mixing frontier models with cheaper local or open sourced ones. Right. Right now it's still experimentation, but those are some of the options that you have. What this really means is this classic commoditization, right? When the cost of these models, well, first of all, the differentiation between those, all these models is about the Same. And the cost is basically, I wouldn't say zero, but it's pretty much the cheapest technology you can find out there in the world. And once we all agree or at least come to some tier where we say, you know, this intelligence is good enough, which, by the way, that's where I am, I was going to actually name this show Good Enough because I do think AI is good enough for 80% of what we do on a daily basis. Once it gets to that level of good enough, the advantage does move elsewhere. And the advantage that we're seeing and we're learning is it moves into workflows, into the tooling, into integration, and obviously reliability. Right. And what I'm learning right now just with Sunshine fm, is really that the real power is going to come based on the system I build around. Everything that Sunshine FM does now, it's meant to be modern media for Palm Springs Coachella. This radio show is the spine of everything that we do. So I've spent many, many months working on systems, changing them out from different models, changing out different workflows. At some point, you as the human have to make the decision and say, this is the system that I think is going to be the best for my use case or for my personality or for my team, whatever metrics you need to work from. But you as a human do have to make that decision. And that's what I'm building in public. And that's where I'm also struggling with. And so that my take right now is that the next generation of winners, especially locally, won't be necessarily AI companies. It'll just be the ones who know how to orchestrate the right tools for the right workflows. And those folks that I talk to locally and in, in the Bay Area, is they the ones I see are getting further ahead. They're the ones, they know which model they want to use, they know how the structure will work within that model, and they know where the humans need to stay in the loop. Now, the pushback that I also hear is these model breakthroughs will recentralize power and that, you know, is there anything we can do about it? I don't know. Unless you go open source, I don't see the, let's say, the centralizing of power being avoided. But for you as an individual or business owner, the workflows you create, they will compound faster the quicker we get into this signal. Number three, Gemini is gaining traffic share, while ChatGPT's consumer traffic softens slightly. We talked about at the end of last year about chat GPT, OpenAI calling a code red because they saw Gemini Pro 3 launched and getting a ton of traffic and a ton of use. I think that's, I think that is real. There's no two ways about it, because I do think Chat GPT is trying to do so much across so many different segments and sectors of society. And that code red, I imagine, is real. I think like, let's say a month since that Code red. Now we're officially about just over a month. I think what I'm also learning is that, yeah, Gemini is gaining traffic because as you know, you're seeing it on your, your Google Maps, you're seeing it on your Google search in AI mode, you're seeing it in your Pixel phones. If you have those, you're seeing it across all the surface areas that Google has, which is distribution, and that OpenAI just doesn't have those. So I think that just makes sense. But I also think, I think what's happening in the last, let's say, couple of quarters is the engagement times definitely differ. I think what I mean by that is you've got just quick surface engagement and then you've got deep engagement and I think the usage patterns are shifting and it's got very little to do which model is better because as I mentioned previously, the models are all commoditizing. It basically comes down to. We talked about this last week in one of the segments about Google releasing personal intelligence. And what does personal intelligence mean? It means Google has said, how can I get Gemini out to the billions of folks who use Google on a daily basis, such as Search, Gmail, Docs, Android, YouTube, you just put all those together and basically we all are exposed to Google in some manner, which then now means we are all exposed to AI and their Gemini model just because we use Google products anyway. And as my agent just has come back with and says people don't choose the defaults, they inherit them. Yeah, I mean, at the end of the day, when it comes to your mobile, you either iOS or Android, and when it comes to your desktop or laptop, you're either Mac or Windows. Is anybody ever going to break those duopolies? I, you know, we've been saying this for decades now. It doesn't seem like it. Having said that, two knows, you know, Google, while it's on a tear right now, it has to do that while possibly killing its golden goose of advertising in search. Right now it seems like it's doing well, but time will tell by the end of this year, by the end of 20, 26, who knows? I don't. I'm not counting OpenAI out at all. I think they are going to be one of the top AI companies in the world. One of the main reasons is because I do think they have brand recognition right now. And every time I talk to anybody out in the valley when I ask about AI, it's ChatGPT that comes that pops first and foremost. It's hardly ever Claude because most people don't know that except I develop a community in town. And while they don't necessarily see Gemini as AI, they know it's part of what they do on Google anyway. So anyway, I do think Open A is going to be sticking around again. I'm talking my own book because I do teach a course called Chat GPT Mastery. So yeah, I have to say that. Right. Okay, fair enough. Okay, signal number five, Agent hype is ahead of economics. Exactly what I just mentioned to you earlier, agentic AI demos are everywhere. Fully autonomous systems are promised daily. Yes, we were promising them last year as well because we were promised them. We were promising it to our clients too. The reality is most enterprises can't afford mass agent deployment at frontier model prices. We, you know, it requires money, requires investment, requires resources and a lot of especially our local leadership, they just not putting those resources to play here. Yet. I say yet. I'm just, that's me being optimistic. The context is this compute does the, the compute costs. They do matter. And so what we're seeing kind of in the world in, in our clients is stage autonomy, checkpointed workflows, human in the loop designs, cheaper models, handling volume work. Now those are my clients locally, those are my clients in Los Angeles because they are putting some money behind it locally. I don't, I'm not exposed to anybody putting money behind this. So that's a separate story. If there was agent panic amongst my developer community last year, that's mostly dissipated they were talking about it's not necessarily going to replace them. They just got to figure out how to use the AI tools themselves to be even better developers, which some of them are. But I think the biggest story last year was how do you sell that narrative to clients. And I think those clients who tried to do this last year and fell in their face, they've learned that no developers are still a big part of this. It's funny because when I, what I've learned over the last 18 months is not so much the how to use the models because I think we're all learning those as on the fly we're getting better. Obviously. The biggest I think unlock for me is again, strategy. So what I do for a living, it's brand strategy. It's that brand strategy I think is the key. That that to me is going to be the key as long as you have a clear vision of where you want to get to and you know how you can, let's say, pivot if you need to, or slightly change lanes for your business. You as the human in the loop, you as the leader of this, it's that design, how you design the business is more important than the intelligence that you're using to get there. Now, again, personal opinion, that's the Sunshine fm. Take another way of thinking about this is this. Don't think of 2026, think in 2031. Where do you want your business to be in five years, what systems you need to put in place and how is AI going to be a part of that in five years? Because likely or not, the way we live with the, in the digital world right now will be almost unrecognizable in five years. There was a great conversation over the holidays. This is signal number six about, especially with coding with Claude, about how SAS is dying. Even one of my favorite podcasts this, this last Friday was talking about and they're venture capitalists and they basically says they no longer invest in any SaaS products. SaaS is software as a service and if the venture capitalists aren't putting money into there, you could say it's kind of dying. From a consumer point of view, it doesn't feel like it's dying. And I think the nuance take right now, especially for the rest of the year, is it's not dying, it's being hollowed out. Yep, Vibe coding has enabled people to spin up micro apps for personal short term use. And apps are becoming disposable, situational and personal. And the context I want to talk quickly mention about they're not dying, they're being hollowed out is it kind of mirrors other industries. We've seen this before. Spreadsheets, they didn't kill databases, websites didn't kill software. But they did change expectations. And so SaaS now competes with you and I, who will just build it. We did a bunch of these little small kind of projects last year in our workshops for folks who are paying, let's say, a couple of thousand dollars a month for a SaaS product. And while we didn't necessarily replace the entire $2,000 or $3,000 a month product because you still need customer service is still need technical help. We lowered their cost because they went down a tier or they had less seats because we were able to build certain agents, certain workflows, certain automations where they didn't need the entire SaaS product. So SaaS will change kind of being hollowed out because you and I, the folks who are experimenting are saying, I don't need that SaaS product because I don't use 80% of the stuff they sell. I'll build my own. And if you're interested in building your own or you need help building, just reach out. I have a community at AICV of developers and builders and strategists who can put this all together for you and possibly help you save a ton of, let's say, subscription cost. And I think one of the most promising things about AI that I've read about and experienced myself over the last couple of months is health care. Now, it's funny because I was speaking to some folks over at Eisenhower and at the Desert Oasis Healthcare about how they're integrating AI. And every time I go to a doctor's appointment or a lab, I ask them, you know, how is AI being integrated here? A couple years ago is mostly just radiologists. That was a conversation and they were saying, yeah, you know, we're using AI to read a lot of this and that, then give it to the doctor. I think what OpenAI just came out with, with their, let's say, sandboxed health piece, I think it's pretty powerful now. Yes. I don't want you to replace your doctor. This is, by the way, this is not financial advice, this is not medical advice, this is not legal advice. This is Sunshine FM advice, I guess. I'm not sure. I have to check with my lawyer. Healthcare is going to be the most valuable AI vertical. It's just going to be also one of the hardest. Individual startups are going to attack it, but it's also going to end up being who's the most trusted. And I think giant health corporations are going to trust the foundational models. They want to go direct to the source, Right? So as the AI companies aggressively move into healthcare, the health questions at massive scale, early integrations, wearables, records and AI convergence, that's where the magic is going to live. Healthcare has massive demand. I can't remember the exact numbers right now, but I think the product manager at OpenAI said something like, I don't know, was it 40,000 healthcare inquiries into chat GPT, you know, every minute or something, people are loading, uploading their medical records and their X rays and even pictures of their, you know, what's happening on their body. And they're trusting AI. This is anecdotal, by the way. This is just my conversations with people is they're trusting AI just as much as they trust a doctor. Meaning that's also because our healthcare is a industry now. It's not individual doctor care. Hasn't been for decades. We all know it. If you're getting, if you've got a great doctor you have a relationship with and his personal congratulations, you're in the minority, the majority of healthcare, it's a business, big business, by the way. And so it doesn't surprise me when folks tell me that they trust the results from ChatGPT just as much as they trust, let's say, the healthcare industry. By the way, if there's anybody from Eisenhower or Desert who wants to talk about this, reach out, DM me, let's have the conversation, because I want to learn how you're integrating this. And I'm sure everybody also wants to know what you're experimenting with and what you're putting out there and obviously what security protocols you have in place. Because I think these two worlds are, are converging. I think healthcare AI will move slower than most people recognize because that's also because there's regulatory drag, there's ethical risk, there's also reputational landmines. But just like AI in general, I have a feeling it's going to be slow and then it's going to be all at once. I may be wrong. Push back on. Push back on this. If you want, just DM me, Come on the show, let's have a conversation about it. I do think. Well, actually, I don't know about the desert. The desert is its own little kind of way of doing business. I know that what's happening in the Bay Area is those health systems are experimenting right now. They're attracting the talent and the startups and the capital. From the top of the pile. And I think those who wait to experiment with this stuff will end up playing catch up. I don't think, I don't. With all the regulation, by the way, I don't think it's necessarily going to stop tech companies taking over a lot of our health, health care systems. That might take 5 years, 10 years or 15 years, 20 years, who knows? I don't think it's going to stop it. Okay, so I'll finish with this. We always knew that ads were coming. We were hoping they weren't. But when you take A just look at technology advertising next to media, your TV, your YouTube, your TikToks, Instagrams. That is basically one of the only ways of monetizing unless you're selling a product. Advertising or digital goods in, in the digital world is one of the only ways of monetizing what you're offering beyond subscriptions and memberships. Advertising is not going away. That's why Facebook and Google are so huge. And so the idea that OpenAI is testing ads in the free ChatGPT tiers is not a surprise. And because they're doing it, all the other platform, AI platforms are also exploring some sort of similar path. I mentioned earlier how Google is actually trying, not trying, their AI mode and AI overviews in their search was at a cost to their traditional search blue links model. So wouldn't be, it wouldn't be a surprise when you start seeing the ads in the AI mode and AI overviews that should say sponsored or advertising. But don't be surprised if they don't or if they just say these are the three we recommend. That's just part of the business. So be, you know, just be on the lookout for which is an ad and which is actual content Surface to you, because AI has reason that this is what you're looking for. What we've seen over the last two, three decades in the tech world is, you know, the way you do it is you build adoption, you subsidize the growth. You know, we saw that with Uber cheap for the longest time and now not cheap. And then you introduce monetization. And the real risk, if you're from a product side of things, like I was, is it's not the ads themselves because at the end of the day, most of us, if they're done well and they're really relevant ads, we don't mind them. It's engagement, optimism, optimization when they're not done well. And I think that's going to be the challenge. Even this red Sunshine fm, even though we're going to have some ads, you know, again, the ads are going to be ads that you can't necessarily either hear or see well, in this case here, because we're an audio media brand anywhere else. And part of that is, well, you'll see when the ads start showing up here, we'll let you know that they're ad jingles. You'll be able to recognize them. You just will. Okay. And the way you're going to recognize them, at least the way I've penciled it out, is between the top of the hour and 11 minutes after. That's where we're going to do the promos and the ads and the station IDs, and then the rest of the 49 minutes is where you'll get the music or the content that you came to listen. But, you know, I say that now, but you watch, in a few months, there'll be something at the bottom of the hour, too, just because we don't want you to lose track of where you are. So, lots to think about. But ads coming into AI, not a surprise. It's happening. I mentioned this last week. OpenAI is doing super bowl ad. Claude is to Gemini, I imagine is. I've seen the OpenAI ad, and it's done supremely well. And it's just to get. It's just to get more mainstream folks into AI, because then the more people you get, the more advertising dollars you can get on the other end, right? That's just. That's just business 101. The key in everything is trust. If Sunshine FM can keep the trust alive and you trust what the information I'm bringing to you and even the entertainment I'm bringing to you, then hopefully you'll stick around because you're getting information and content that you're not. You're not able to get anywhere else, especially here in Palm Springs, Coachella and, you know, from my building in public, everything here, apart from this human voice and the human voice that we bring on as guests, everything else is AI generated. That's, you know, good, bad or ugly. That is just what Sunshine FM is. It's an experiment in AI tools and services, content and gen and. And Personas. So when you come here, you know, there's no surprise. We're not hiding it. Unlike other outlets that you're going to be left guessing is that AI is not. Is that not AI here. Here, everything is AI generated. Not because we think it's better. We just want to create a space where, you know, when you come here, you're here to see what it's all about. You're here to dive deeper into what AI possibly could do and hopefully see some options for. I need to avoid that, or I need to dig deeper into that and let me reach out to Sunshine FM and our community of idea people, designers, creatives, tinkerers, experimenters, developers, coders, all together. We can start basically wrapping our arms around what a. What this AI thing is all about. So that's basically kind of the signal, as I mentioned before, as I get into my own flow, my own rhythm, there's three segments. I want to run the signal, local intelligence and community notes right now. Reach out to me. You've got my. For those that know me, just reach out. Text me. I get a lot of texts and get a lot of emails to Sunshine FM about things that they want to talk about, the things that they are pushing back against. I'm happy to have those conversation. Be happy to answer all these questions and thoughts on air as we find our rhythm and we get going. Okay, well, I'll leave you with is the only thing I can promise. You know, my, my. One of my main goals about experimenting and building in public is to reach out. I've got a bunch of friends up in the Bay Area who, who sometime this year are going to be multimillionaires because of their stocks and options within some of these AI companies. And when they do, I have no doubt they're going to be looking for a next chapter in their life. And while they have many, many places they can go to in the country or the world, my pitch to them is consider Palm Springs Coachella. We don't have the infrastructure yet, but they could help bring their expertise, their ideas, their energy and resources into our nascent startup ecosystem to actually help create what I believe is missing in Palm Springs Coachella. And that is this ecosystem for startups and founders and creatives. So if you're listening, boys. Oh, and girl, Sunshine FM is your place. Sunshine fm Modern media for Palm Springs Coachella. See you tomorrow.
