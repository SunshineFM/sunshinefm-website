  "articleBody": "At the second Future PS AI networking event held at the Agua Caliente Cultural Museum on January 21st, a significant gap emerged between what local AI practitioners need and what civic leadership is providing. The event featured AI artist Kelly Bosch and College of the Desert's basic AI curriculum announcement, but organizer Sat observed that \"when Kelly was mentioning Nana Banana as one of the image generators, as I was looking around the room I could see basically, maybe anecdotally, the majority of people had no idea what Kelly was talking about.\" Having run over 25 hands-on AI workshops at Cal State University's ERC building in 2024, Sat noted the event felt too basic for the developer and creative community that exists locally. The networking format struggled to facilitate new connections, with people mostly talking to those they already knew. While College of the Desert announced a four-week AI course through their Hospitality program at the Palm Desert mall location, Sat questioned whether this rudimentary approach addresses the real need: \"Two years later I think our goal has changed to how do we actually get this integrated into business and enterprise.\" This signals a critical opportunity gap in the Coachella Valley AI ecosystem. While civic institutions focus on AI basics, there's an underserved community of developers, creatives, and business owners ready for deeper technical conversations about implementation. Local entrepreneurs like Nikolai Andretti with DreamCloud and Jeff Harrison with Swingping Point Media are experimenting with advanced AI tools, but lack community infrastructure to collaborate and share knowledge. The disconnect between \"the speed of AI\" and local institutional response creates space for alternative education and networking models like Sunshine FM's hands-on approach. Businesses seeking practical AI integration may find more value in peer-to-peer learning networks than in current institutional offerings. Local Palm Desert AI artist Kelly Bosch, who has attracted 1.5 million followers with her AI-generated visual and music content created using Midjourney and Suno, revealed that Bandcamp removed all AI-generated music from its platform last week. This development emerged during conversations at the Future PS event, where Sat asked Bosch \"about SUNO and how the radio stations and music labels are going to manage this.\" The consensus from Bosch, her manager Kim, and other music industry attendees was stark: \"AI is just automatically being integrated in all the radio stations generally. And that it's so far gone in terms of Suno can't claw back what training data is out there in the ecosystem.\" The implication is that most platforms are \"just letting it run and dealing with, let's say, the pushback either from artists or for consumers.\" Sat observed that AI-generated content now dominates social feeds, estimating \"maybe 51% of that stuff is AI generated\" on Instagram and Facebook, while \"80% of that stuff is just AI generated\" on LinkedIn. Bandcamp's decision to ban AI music represents a rare counter-movement, forcing artists like Bosch to rely on YouTube, Instagram, Spotify, and her own website. The music industry faces an irreversible transformation where AI-generated content has already saturated distribution channels faster than regulation or ethical frameworks can respond. For AI music creators in the Coachella Valley like Kelly Bosch, platform diversification becomes essential as some services may reject AI content while others embrace it. Traditional musicians and music businesses must recognize that AI music tools like Suno have already trained on existing catalogs, making legal remedies potentially futile. The entertainment and media sectors in Palm Springs and the broader Coachella Valley should anticipate similar platform fragmentation across other content types, creating both distribution challenges and niche opportunities for AI-native creators who can navigate multiple platforms simultaneously. Anthropic released an updated \"Constitution\" for its Claude AI model, replacing its 2023 founding document with a new manifesto organized around four main principles that emphasize safety, ethics, compliance, and genuine helpfulness. The company specifically stated that Claude should \"not supersede a human's ability to correct and control its values or behavior\" and should function as \"a brilliant friend who knows pretty much anything and wants to treat users like intelligent adults.\" This positioning comes as competitors like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Elon Musk's xAI face various controversies. Sat noted that \"while there was some skepticism about, you know, this Constitution, I think the, you know, if you're in the AI bubble... there are conversations about how these AI entities have some sort of semblance of consciousness in the future.\" The move aligns with Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei's warning at Davos that unchecked AI could leave millions behind, with his statement that \"I don't think there's an awareness at all of what is coming here and the magnitude of it.\" From user experience, Sat observed that \"Claude seems to be the most trustworthy, foundational model for the time being\" particularly for enterprise applications, even as Microsoft and Google maintain advantages through existing corporate relationships. Anthropic's ethical positioning creates a differentiation strategy that resonates with enterprise customers and cautious adopters concerned about AI safety and responsibility. For Coachella Valley businesses evaluating AI adoption, Claude's emphasis on human oversight and transparent principles may prove more suitable than consumer-focused alternatives, particularly for sensitive applications in healthcare, legal services, or financial sectors prominent in the region. The constitutional framework also signals that AI providers are beginning to compete on values and governance models, not just capabilities, which means organizations should evaluate foundational models based on alignment with their own ethical standards and risk tolerance. Startups and agencies in the valley should monitor whether Claude's \"adult in the room\" approach translates to sustained enterprise market share against Microsoft's Copilot and Google's Gemini advantages. Entrepreneur Nikolai Andretti attended the Future PS event with his AI robotic companion called Millie, representing his umbrella company DreamCloud and robotics education initiative called Millennial Tech AI. Sat, who invited Andretti to the event, believes \"if he can make the right connections in town, I think having a maker's lab in the Coachella Valley would be a big, big win.\" The initiative focuses on computer aided design, 3D printing, and AI robotics, primarily targeting high school and university students. Sat emphasized that \"because he's so early, I think if you are interested in computer aided design, 3D printing, AI robotics, and how all of that comes together\" people should connect with Andretti. The maker lab concept represents hands-on technical education operating outside traditional academic institutions, as Sat noted \"it's needed and it's not necessarily working where I play, but I'm glad to see that there's somebody out there trying to do this on a private level, not necessarily a, let's say COD or Cal State University level.\" Sat acknowledged uncertainty about what school districts are doing in this space, saying \"I'd like to know what the school districts are doing with this. I imagine they are. I just don't know enough about it.\" The DreamCloud maker lab initiative addresses a critical gap in hands-on technical education that traditional Coachella Valley institutions aren't filling quickly enough. With College of the Desert's AI accelerator still 2.5 years away and current course offerings described as \"very rudimentary,\" private initiatives like Andretti's could provide immediate pathways for young people to develop practical AI, robotics, and fabrication skills. For local businesses in manufacturing, hospitality tech, or creative industries, a functioning maker lab could become a talent pipeline and prototyping resource. The initiative's early stage presents an opportunity for investors, real estate providers, or corporate sponsors to support practical STEM education infrastructure. If successful, this model could demonstrate that private educational ventures can move faster than academic institutions in emerging technology fields, potentially inspiring similar initiatives across other technical domains in the valley."

                <p>Entrepreneur Nikolai Andretti attended the Future PS event with his AI robotic companion called Millie, representing his umbrella company DreamCloud and robotics education initiative called Millennial Tech AI. Sat, who invited Andretti to the event, believes "if he can make the right connections in town, I think having a maker's lab in the Coachella Valley would be a big, big win."
