# Transcript: Friday 01-16-2026

Hello, hello, hello. That was Rani Brit, Sikh from London, checking into the hotels here in Pontiff. Palm Springs Coachella. You're listening to Sunshine fm, modern media for Palm Springs Coachella. Yes, every morning at 11ish in the 11ish hour. Anyway, we'll go ahead and break some of this wonderful music and come to you live from Palm Springs Coachella. Actually, Rancho Mirage, if I have to be honest, because it's right in the middle of Palm Springs Coachella to talk about what all of this is. Sunshine FM is modern media for Palm Springs Coachella. It's a place where we can go ahead and have conversations about startups, startup ecosystems, AI and technology, small business, work, life and play of the future, and what that means for palm Screens Coachella, and what that means for all of us who call this place home. I'm Sat. I'm your station manager. This is an experiment in humans and the AIs collaborating to create something from scratch. And in this case, a radio station. Who would have thunk? A radio station in this day and age that's dying is what everybody's telling you. That might be so, but I'm into retro, dude, digital, which is another way of saying maybe some things that were old are coming back again. I don't know, maybe some pieces of that might be true as we, as I have these conversations, many, many people in town and in Silicon Valley, in Los Angeles, yeah, there is a little bit of kind of, let's say, yearning for olden days or glory days or back in the day, etcetera, And I kind of call that analog. And yep, I suffer from it myself. As we head into this world of everything AI. Well, that human connection, something we still need. I can shout out a couple of my friends in town who always, always talk to me and rail on me about social connection and that humans will never go away. And my argument never is humans will go away. I actually have no argument at all. This is a safe space for the good, the bad, the ugly. It's basically a space where we should have these conversations what AI promises and what the perils are that we need to be mindful of. And if you haven't seen my TEDx talk, I encourage you to at least listen to it, purely because in that talk about AI, I basically say how conflicted I am about where we're heading with AI. I can see the promise and the potential. Yet at the same time, there are many things we need to be guarding. Guarding, I'm going to say against, but a guarding just be. Just be Mindful of. Okay, so what is Sunshine fm? It's an experiment with AI. This is not a polished podcast. This is not professional radio. Those guys have done this for decades. They know what they're doing. I, on the other hand, I'm building in public and experimenting in public, and I need your help in getting back to me, what with what you like, what you don't like. There are no subscription buttons, there are no smash that like buttons. It's purely. If you want to get a. If you got something to say, reach out to me and let's get you on air and let's have a conversation about business, startups, AI and technology, culture, music. I'm going to get into music today, Hollywood, creativity, what it means to be creative as a human in this era of AI. And so one of the experiments that we're doing right now for this break in the music is what I a segment I call Local Intelligence, where I just take maybe three, four, five articles or let's say, posts about AI that have kind of, you know, interested me over the last 24 hours and where I think there might be something to surface and then have a conversation, at least bring it to your attention, then have a conversation what it means for Palm Springs Coachella. So with that in mind, here's the format. There's an old Don Henley song in which he says there's three sides to every story of basically have adopted that for many decades. And yes, there's a pro, there's a con, and then there's something in the middle that has some sort of truth. And so the con, the, the format for local intelligence is basically that it's three deep takes on AI startups and technology. And the first one really is about the AI assistant wars. Where are we? Right. Chat GPT was dropped basically November 22, November 2022. So three, just over three years. My world has changed significantly since it dropped. Has everybody's world? Not necessarily. If you're in the bubble, you see it, you feel it on a daily basis. If you're not, it's basically business as usual. But where are we to date? And I'll give you a quick little kind of like the positive take about the big foundational models. OpenAI dominates small businesses, anthropic crushes enterprise, and Google is quietly winning the integration game. But here's what matters. Competition forces better products. By the way, this is the positive take. OpenAI move fast. It they built consumer trust. They got into classrooms and small businesses first. Yes, I remember Those days around 36.8% of businesses using ramp pay for OpenAI products. Anthropic is at 16.7%. But here's the thing nobody's talking about. Anthropic is eating OpenAI's lunch. In enterprise companies like IBM, Deloitte, Accenture, Cognizant, Travelers, they have all chosen Claude. Why? Because Anthropic actually cares about security and doing things right. And here comes Google. Google has the infrastructure, the data, and now the phone. This is how a healthy market works. For Palm Springs, Coachella specifically, you should care about this because it tells you who's actually building AI that works. If you're building a small startup here, OpenAI is accessible and cheap. If you're building something that needs enterprise trust, Anthropic is your bet. If you want it everywhere, across devices, across platforms, well, Google owns the infrastructure. This fragmentation is actually good. It means better products, lower prices, more choices. Well, that's free market talk for you. So here's the pushback. This is nothing more than consolidation dressed as competition. Let me be honest. The real story is that nobody's building the world's best AI anymore because that market is commoditizing. What matters now is access. OpenAI has first mover Advantage and Consumer Mindshare, but their user growth is slowing. They're burning $9 billion a year. Nobody knows how that's sustainable. Anthropic is raising billions to compete, but they're playing enterprise catch up. In a market where OpenAI already has relationships, Google has the biggest advantage. It owns the the phone, Android Search, Gmail, workspace. They can integrate AI everywhere without asking permission. And now, through the Apple deal, they're powering Siri on 2 billion iPhones. The competition is really three companies carving up the world. Startups get open AI because it's free and accessible. Enterprises get locked into one of the three, usually whoever they've picked first, and consumers get whatever their phone ships with, which is increasingly Google. That's not competition, that's division of market territory. So here's the Sunshine FM take. When you see both these forces, here's what's actually might be happening. The frontier model wars are over. Nobody's building the world's smartest AI anymore because that's too expensive and takes too long. And what's happening now is specialization. OpenAI owns consumers and SMBs because they move first and built brand trust. Anthropic owns enterprise because they're disciplined and security focused. Google owns infrastructure because they spent 20 years building data centers and networks. The real competition isn't whose Model is smarter. It's whose stack integrates deepest into the parts of your life you already use. So for founders here in Palm Springs, Coachella, this kind of matters because it tells you something about the next wave of startups. The winners won't be building better AI models. The winners will be building better applications on top of these models. Better workflows, better products, better integrations. That's what we've been teaching all last year in our workshops at Cal State. And what we've also learned is you don't compete with Open Air by building chat GPT 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. You compete by building something that uses ChatGPT in a way nobody else has is thinking of. And that's where the opportunity is. And that's why Palm Screens Coachella could be pretty interesting right now. So, in case you're wondering how this kind of is working, it's mostly because we fed these questions and these articles into a couple of agents I've built, and they're coming back with the positive take and the pushback take. I'll be right back. Story number two, there was a little break, by the way, as you know, this is a radio station experiment, and I had some challenges there with a new agentic workflow that I built yesterday using Claude code. And not being a software engineer, I was able to get pretty far. But I think something just basically launched by itself, which is okay, because I wanted to do that. I wanted to basically record what we're talking about here, and then it goes through an agentic workflow where it's basically repurposing this content across a variety of digital interfaces where Sunshine FM is going to live. More on that later. Anyway, experiment in public. This what happens. Things break, things fall apart. And this is where you learn. This is where you learn. So story number two, I'll go quickly on this one. Sam Altman's brain implant, which is Merge Labs. The positive take is that Sam Altman is betting $250 million that the future of human AI collaboration isn't screens and keyboards, it's direct neural integration. Okay, well, I agreed with him about the screens and keyboards. I'm going audio. But he's going deeper. He's going direct neural integration. Not today, but in 10 years. His thinking is, your thoughts flow directly into AI without friction. Your AI understands context at the neurological level. This is the merge between biology and intelligence. Merge Labs is building the standard that neural interfaces will eventually use. Wow. Well, you know, the positive take is that this is coming, and whoever writes the standard owns the future. That's a big bet, right? So the pushback. This is a billionaire playing God with venture capital. Brain computer interfaces have massive liability, consent and privacy risks that nobody's really solved. What happens when your thoughts are data? Who owns that data? What if the AI misinterprets your neural signals and makes a decision you didn't intend? Let's be honest. This is neurotechnology, designed to make you a better consumer, a better worker, a better input source for AI systems. This is not about human flourishing. It's about extracting more value from human cognition. Okay, there's more that my AI agent said about this, but in. In the essence of time, let's go ahead and carry on with what my sunshine FM take. Okay, so this is not necessarily about implants just yet, right? It's about building the standard that neural interfaces will event use. Sam Altman is right that this is coming. We've also heard Elon Musk talk about this for many, many years. But the tension is this. The infrastructure layer that makes brain AI integration seamless is also the thing that gives whoever controls it godlike power. So the real question isn't will brain computer interfaces happen? It's who gets to write the rules. I mean, you can expand that across all kinds of sectors of the economy, right? Sam Altman's betting that OpenAI should. That's either visionary or terrifying, depending on what you think about concentrated tech power. So for Palm Springs Coachella, this is why the tech talent conversation matters here. The people building Merge labs are the same people building the future of human AI interaction. If your region has smart operators interested in this stuff, you should be talking to them. Because this infrastructure layer, whoever builds it, will matter more than the consumer apps running on top of it. Okay, that was a bit repetitive. Apologize for that Story number three. This is really interesting because I have a really, really good friend who I really admire and she does a ton of reporting in retail and E comm and she's a journalist and so she really gets deep in some of this stuff. So I'm always interested in on how agentic shopping and AI agents are going to do our shopping for us. And so Google just came out with their blog on their website, and the positive take on their universal commerce protocol is Google just democratized agentic commerce. Small retailers can now compete with Amazon because their inventory is accessible to AI agents running on Google's surfaces. A shopper says, I need a rug that's durable, stylish, under $500. And an AI agent instantly checks inventory Across Target, Wayfair, Walmart and Etsy. The best price wins, best match wins, friction disappears. The positive take is that this is a this is good for consumers faster, better deals and good for retailers access to high intent shoppers. The universal commerce protocol means every retailer plays by the same rules. It's not Amazon owned infrastructure, it's open. Retailers like Lowe's, Michaels, Poshmark and Reebok are already live. This is real. All right, so you can imagine the positive agent saying that. Now you can imagine the pushback agent saying this is a play to lock retailers into Google's ecosystem while pretending to be open. And that's in quotes. Google controls the AI Surfaces search Gemini. Google controls the payment layer. Google controls the data. When a retailer plugs into ucp, they're giving Google visibility into their entire inventory, customer behavior and pricing. Google's Direct Offers pilot, that's Google deciding which deals show up, which retailers get visibility and at what price. This isn't democratization. It's a new kind of walled garden where Google is the gatekeeper and retailers have no choice because that's where the customers are. Wow. That's a story as old as 20 years that we've been living in. So here's the hopefully the nuanced sunshine FM takes again, just like most things, both things are true. UCP is genuinely useful infrastructure that levels a playing field for small retailers. But open doesn't mean neutral. Google still controls the services where this happens. And here's the thing that nobody's talking about. Agentic shopping means humans stop making decisions. Then AI decides what you should buy based on price, availability and data that Google has about you. And if you remember yesterday, I talked about Google releasing or actually integrating personal intelligence into every one of Google's consumer apps. This is the data that we're talking about here. Now that's efficient, but it also means retailers stop competing on brand, story and culture. They compete on algorithm. And that's a big yuck. Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to put my personal opinion on there, but that's it came out for big retailers with scale, that's fine. For the small business owner in Palm Springs, Coachella, who have built something with soul. Well, this is how you might get replaced by an API. Last year we taught a bunch of workshops about how agentic commerce was coming and we trained early versions of how you as a small business in Palm Swings Coachella should get surfaced, should get recognized and cited not just for your storytelling in your blogs and your posts, but also what is it that you're offering that could be a direct match to what a user users intent is. Because we also do believe that as Google starts moving traditional search into AI mode, more and more search will be done through LLMs. We may be wrong, but that's the bet that we were taking back then. It's still the bet that we're taking now. And so we had a lot of training and a lot of tools that we curated and, and basically showcase to small businesses and founders and entrepreneurs so they can get ahead of this. Now that was about six months ago. This is now just ramping up on, on the reality side. And yeah, the future of retail is faster and cheaper and less human. Whether that's progress depends on what you value. Right. So again, those were just some quick hits. Things that kind of popped up on my radar, popped up on my newsletters and on the podcast I listened to and just, you know, I'm happy to share how I do some of this because at the end of the day I maybe like you subscribe to hundreds of newsletters and listen to as many podcasts as I can. When I'm out hiking, when I'm out in, you know, driving around, and when I'm out, you know, waiting or shopping, I'll be listening to podcasts. The thing is, how do you take this data and this content that you're consuming and how can we share it with the rest of, in my case, Palm Springs Coachella. And the bigger case is I have a few friends in, in the Bay Area that are pretty soon going to be newly minted millionaires, most probably 20, 26 when in when OpenAI possibly goes IPO. Maybe they won't. When definitely Nvidia. I've got one guy over at Nvidia, possibly SpaceX goes public this year and there's a whole bunch of acquisitions being being had right now. So I have friends in the Bay Area going to be newly minted multi millionaires and this experiment in radio is my version also to reach out to them, say Palm Springs Coachella is not a bad place for your next chapter. So anyway, that's local intelligence. There is another segment that I, I'm experimenting with toying with and it's called source code. And what source code the, the concept behind that is it's like a deep dive connecting dots that have local implication. In the not too distant future, Source code will also be the place where I'll have conversations with other founders and entrepreneurs and business owners in the leadership class here in Palm Springs Coachella and we'll have those kind of back and forth with another human, as it were, in this deep dive. But until then, until we have enough content and information before we go truly live with everything, this is just me doing a deep dive on a specific topic. And so here's the deep dive that I mentioned yesterday and I want to quickly go into it today and hopefully get some comments back on my email newsletter that I send out every Sunday. And that is this. There was a. Okay, there's two parts to this. Okay. There's a regional part about data centers. That was in, I think Virginia is where this actually happened. Give me a second. Let me just quickly. Where is that? Oh, maybe I'll. Oh, here we go. Right here. Pennsylvania is where it was. Okay. Okay. The data center, electricity, debt, it's not hypothetical. It's happening here. Okay. So I don't know if you know this and maybe most people don't know this in Palm Springs Coachella and maybe only those folks who are news junkies or live nearby may have access to this information. And by the way, I haven't had. I haven't been able to get a ton of recent information. So if this is a dead story, don't mind me, feel free to DM me and let me know. It's a dead story. But here's the situation. Right now In Imperial County, 15 minutes from the city of Coachella, a $10 billion 330 megawatt AI data center is being proposed by Imperial Valley Computer Manufacturing. I have no idea who they are. This is the largest data center project in California history. I did not know that the facility would sit on 74 acres at the intersection of Clark Road and Atten Road in unincorporated Imperial county. It includes a 950,000 square foot data center with a 330 megawatt capacity and 862 megawatt hertz. Is that right? Sorry about this. I go back to Eng English school for this battery energy storage system using 220 Tesla megapacks and 330 megawatts emergency backup generator building which I said earlier on, powered by 132 Caterpillar Natural Gas generators. This must all come from their pitch deck. I'm pretty positive it does. And a dedicated electrical substation connecting to Imperial Irrigation Districts grid. This is being built 15 minutes from Coachella. This is in our region. Now I happen to be in Southern California Edison which has its own issues. We'll get to that some other day. This is in the Imperial Irrigation district. So this came. I bring this up purely because it was an article in on the east coast, which was the Washington angle. The Washington angle that I mentioned yesterday with Microsoft was that the White House and governors from Pennsylvania, Ohio and Virginia are holding emergency meetings about AI data centers, driving up electricity costs. And why are they having these emergency meetings, as I mentioned yesterday? Well, midterms are just around the corner now. Microsoft has committed to subsidizing residential electricity rates in regions where they build. The president personally weighed in saying Microsoft would make major changes to guarantee US Consumers don't see their utility bills increase. Again, midterms around the corner. Why? Because consumer advocates say rate pairs in the Mid Atlantic grid are already paying billions of dollars in higher bills to underwrite the cost of supplying power to data centers. This is becoming a political issue. And if the previous pitch deck that I was reading from is real, and again, feel free to DM me and let me know it's debunked. If it's real. This is becoming our own local issue. So in my, in my normal kind of format of. Okay, here's the glossy take on this and here's the pushback. The glossy take is this. A $10 billion investment in Imperial county is transformative. Developers are saying water positive. That's in quotes. They'll use reclaimed wastewater and clean it. They're saying interruptible service, if the grid needs emergency power will shut down. To protect residents. They are creating jobs. They are adding $9 billion to county assessed value, which would increase property tax revenue and dilute the tax burden for residents paying off school bonds. This could be what good infrastructure looks like. Smart developers, responsible planning, real economic impact. And Imperial Valley residents who've watched the Spreckels sugar plant close and struggle with economic stagnation could actually benefit from this. The developers who are apparently presenting to local Rotary and Kiwanis clubs are framing this as an economic lifeline and a for a region that's been overlooked. It just might be. So here's the pushback. This is the problem when there's no transparency. Most Imperial Valley residents didn't know about this until the county had already approved it and construction was advancing. H, again, DM me if this has already been debunked. Okay, if this is happening, we need to keep an eye on this, right? Here are the numbers. The 330 megawatt facility would consume nearly 30% of the Imperial Irrigation District's entire available energy supply. For context, IID says one megawatt powers roughly 1,000 homes. So one data center is the same as powering 330,000 homes. And here's the kicker. IID said in their system impact study that they don't have the capability to reliably support this load with existing resources. They literally said we cannot commit to serve the requested load. So who's going to pay for the grid upgrades? Who pays when power gets cut? Let me tell you, the residents, that's who. And the water? A mid sized Data center uses 300,000 gallons of water per day. We may have to recheck that because I know there was some nuance based on how the calculations were done previously in other data centers. So I'm not sure if that number is as of today or if this is using the same calculation last year. But bottom line, if you do the math, in a region that's already stressed by Colorado river water limits, it's somewhat concerning. The project was approved, by the way, with an exemption from California Environmental Quality act environmental review. The city of Imperial sued to stop it and almost nobody in the valley knows it's happening. Okay, again, if this is all real, we should be concerned. If it's stuff that my agent is making up, I apologize. Control, alt, delete this episode. Okay, here's the Sunshine FM take. Okay, maybe a data center is coming to our region whether we like it or not. The Imperial county project shows what happens when one city loses control of the narrative. The county approved it quietly. The city of Imperial found out after the fact ensued. Residents just learned about it. IID is scrambling to explain what they can and cannot control. And here's the real story. IID just sent out a statement saying they've received multiple data center inquiries across this service territory ranging from 30 megawatts to 1 gigawatt per site. One gigawatt, that's code. Four more of these are coming. So the question for Palm Springs, Coachella, Rancho Mirage and the rest of the Valley isn't whether you want a data center, it's whether you're going to have a voice in how it happens. Because if we wait until county approval, we're too late. If we wait until construction starts, we're too late. We need to be asking our city council right now. Five questions. Are you in conversations with developers? What's the real plan? Who's going to decide if we're water positive or water negative? Who pays for the grid upgrades? And will our residents be informed before or after the decision? So based on this, let's say I'm putting this in quotes based on this reporting, based on the pitch deck, based on the stuff that's online currently and Based on my agent that I'm presuming does hallucinate sometimes, maybe most of the time. But it's getting better, right? Used to be 50, 50 was made up. Now it's more like maybe 15%, maybe 5% is made up. The majority of the story seems to hold water. And the question that we should have is, are these decisions being made in closed rooms with environmental exceptions? Exemptions, I should say, are they. Are they being made quietly? That's the template, at least what we're learning. Unless our city council decides, that's not the way it's going to be done locally. Going back to what Microsoft actually promised, I mentioned this yesterday, so if you missed it yesterday, it's live yesterday. It might show up in a podcast later on this weekend. We're still working on that. What Microsoft actually promised is that they'd subsidize residential electricity rates in regions where they build data centers. That's a promise to limit some of the damage, not solve the problem. As I mentioned yesterday, magical pr. And here's why this matters. If Microsoft is promising to subsidize rates, that means the base reality is that rates go up, the subsidy is temporary, it only applies to some customers, and it doesn't solve the fundamental problem of whether you have enough power. So in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Virginia, governors are holding emergency meetings about this exact issue. It's becoming a political problem. It's about to become our problem, most probably. And the local angle, The IID territory includes Coachella and the Imperial Valley. They've received multiple data center inquiries. Our city council should be talking about this openly, and we should have plans. They should be asking, if a data center comes here, what does that mean for our residents? What's the deal? Who benefits? Who pays? I know Palm Springs is in talks with data center companies. I don't necessarily get that much information ahead of time, but that's just mostly me because I don't live in Palm Springs. Anyway, I'm sure they send out newsletters that I don't open. So local source, that was a deep dive into something that we all should be at least looking into. And by the way, we don't all have the time to go into what's the pros and cons of a data center. And I don't blame you if this. If you just basically skip past this information, this conversation, it's okay. At the end of the day, it feels like it's almost out of our hands anyway. AI is coming whether we like it or not. Didn't ask for it, but it's coming across everything that we do. They need data centers. Data centers are coming left, right and center. And by the way, they have the money to build it, to subsidize temporarily, etc. Etc. You know, the playbook that Silicon Valley and big business does. Anyway, I don't need to go into that. I'm going to finish up with, I wouldn't say a lighter note, but it is something that is weighs on me on a daily basis. And it was brought to me, it was brought to my attention early this morning at breakfast about Grammys and AI music. And you'll know why this means a lot to me. Because Sunshine FM is a space, a safe space for AI generated content, including AI generated music, jingles, station IDs, interstitials, et cetera, et cetera. So here's the situation. The Recording Academy just updated its rules. AI generated music can be nominated, but only if it has meaningful human authorship. Pure AI. No human input is ineligible. But music that integrates AI alongside human creativity can qualify. The Grammy CEO Harvey Mason Jr. Said the Grammy is a human award. It's about excellence in music created by people. This is industry trying to protect human musicians while technology reshapes everything. What's the positive take, you ask? Let me tell you, the Grammys got this right. A musician using AI to generate lyrics, then editing them, then performing them, that's art. That's eligible. An AI generating a song with zero human input, that's not art, that's data. This protects human musicians while allowing innovation. Producers can use AI in their workflow. Vocalists can use AI to pitch correct or layer vocals. Songwriters can use AI as ideation tools. But the final creation has to be meaningfully human. The Beatles AI song, which was John Lennon's voice cleaned up by AI, then performed, will probably be eligible because the core performance is still human. And the positive agent says that feels right. Yeah, I apologize if I'm putting some my own kind of slant on this. So here's the pushback. And I hear this because I have a ton of friends in Hollywood and the recording industry in Los Angeles. And that's an industry I come from. And we've been talking about this for many, many years, by the way, not just before AI, but let's just say in the AI bubble right now. The pushback is this. The Grammys are drawing a line that's already washing away meaningful human authorship. Sounds good until you ask whose version of meaningful. If an artist uses AI to write a song, then changes two lines and then performs it is that meaningful. If a producer uses AI to generate beats, then chops 80% of it up and recombines, it is that meaningful. In 10 years, this distinction will be meaningless. AI will be so integrated into music production that separating AI music from human music will be like separating digital music from analog music. Now what the Grammys are really saying is we're protecting the jobs of human musicians while technology reshapes the industry. That's honest, but it's also protectionism. I'm not sure that's a pushback. That would be kind of like my take, really. All right, so what is my take? My take is the music industry watched what happened to photography and graphic design when AI got good. They're trying to avoid that collapse by drawing a line. Humans win Grammys, AI doesn't. Is it useful? Yeah, maybe for now. But like the pushback said, 10 years. I don't think it's going to take 10 years. I already see kids responding to AI generated music and AI generated images and AI generated video as entertainment, as content, as news, with no questioning that whether a human had a hand in this at all. That's the next generation. If you're like me, who had a foot in the analog world, I would imagine we have some, not just discernment, but maybe some preference for one over the other. Right? So I don't think it's going to take 10 years. I imagine this whole AI in music and AI in movies, I think it's going to be gone. This, this conversation is going to be gone by next year. 2027, 2028. the, the outset, Ray Kurzweil basically had said, AGI, where AI takes over all jobs, is 2029. So keep that, keep that in your pocket whenever, for whenever that comes around. Here's why this kind of matters, right? It does force artists to claim their humanity. If you use AI, you have to say so. You have to own the role AI played. You have to prove a human made meaningful creative decisions. That's not protectionism, that's transparency. And transparency is how you protect creators in an AI native world. I think you know this from day one. Sunshine FM is an experiment in AI. And apart from this voice that you're hearing right now, maybe one hour a day, and maybe some other voices that we invite to the show, other humans. The rest of the programming is AI generated. It's a space where even user generated content, user generated AI music or content will be not just acceptable. This is what it's all about. I'm trying to experiment, to show where we might be going with this stuff and that. If you don't want AI generated music in your world, you have traditional radio, you have Spotify all day long, you have YouTube music. Please go there and support whatever artists you're not paying for already. If you want to see where AI music, AI generated production and songwriting and all that stuff that goes into making records, come here, listen to what we're. Listen to what we're doing. Listen to some of the stuff that's pretty cool, some of it's not. Some of it is fun, Most of it experimental. Most of it would be demos. As a matter of fact, these are better demos than I ever came out with back in the day. But just think of them as demos, but they're demos that might be good enough for, I don't know, for me, as a radio station manager, licensing traditional music, it's not cheap. And that's why you tend to hear the same old, you know, 500 songs on rotation. Because it's. That's, that's because they know the business model is people will stop scrolling or stop tuning if they hear a song they like. And we are creatures of habit. So if that's you, great. You've got, you know, 50 other radio stations in town to go to. That's fantastic. I listen to them too, here and there when I'm driving around, when I'm not on a podcast. But if you want to know where AI generated music is going, this is the safe space. We'll have about many, many hours of AI generated music and content for experimental sake, for conversation sake, and to open your ears and eyes to what might be possible. So the real question for the Grammys is, yeah, what does meaningful human authorship actually mean when AI tools are as natural to modern music as pro tools? A young producer in Palm Springs, coachella, might use AI the way a 1995 producer used samples. You know, I never use samples as a core creative tool. Is that less meaningful than a 1960s songwriter with an acoustic guitar? Maybe not. Maybe it's just different. Well, we can go back and forth on. You know what? I would love to have some AI actually. I would love to have some musicians and songwriters and record label owners come on the show and let's discuss this. I'm not taking a stance on it. I'm experimenting with it. For sure. I like my, my eight track music. That's what I was raised on, grew up with. And my sister station, 8 Track Radio, it's coming online later this summer. That's my analog station. So the Grammys are saying, show your work, tell us what you did. Prove the human was in there making choices. I don't know if that's true. Okay, Is that fair? Yeah, I guess so. The Grammys, Oscars, you're all in trouble. Who may not be in trouble, by the way, Tony's right. Tony's man. You might just come on up. Okay, I'm making a quick little prediction. I just thought of it just while I'm scrolling through my script. The Tonys are going to be the most watched award show, surpassing Oscars, Grammys, Emmys. Because at the end of the day, the Tonys you cannot replace with AI or robots just yet. The humanoids are coming. Toss the keys to been hid in the vest. He looks at the spirit scratch on the fender. I say, don't worry, darling, it's a rented Tesla. Sorry about the ending, but pretty sweet, right? That's Ronnie R A N I.

But the sliding doors open and down we go, 68 degrees and the scent of pine smells like Lily's linen and expensive wine. I keep the sunglasses on. I keep the head down low, walking across them all like I run the show. A lady in the corner gives me a stare. I give her nothing back but a little adjustment of the hair. I'm checking in. Don't call me up. Don't look at me. On the radio. I step to the desk, the clerk's mouth too wide. I'll come to the desert. Let's get you inside. He asked for a name. I pause for a beat.
