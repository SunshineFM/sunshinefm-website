It's. Good morning. Monday, January 12, 11 o', clock, Sunshine FM. Modern media for Palm Springs Coachella. What you're not going to get here is a polished broadcast. This is purely an experiment. If you listen to my intro on 111, that Sunshine FM is pretty much this. It's just me, one human and an army of agents. And we're going to learn together and work together and build this together in public about how AI is going to impact every single aspect of our living, working and playing here in Palm Springs Coachella. Anyway, I've live by the way, this is live, right? So I've created a few agents, some co hosts, some research agents, using Claude, using Chat, GPT, using Gemini and various other tools. And if you're playing around with AI, you know these services that I'm talking about, if you're not in AI, some of these services are most probably already infiltrating how you use the Internet. Opinionated fact. AI is the technical de facto interface to how you access the Internet. That's how it's been for some time. Generated AI is now where we're headed to and that is where Sunshine FM is all about. We're experiment, experimenting in real time to see the, the pros and the cons of AI and hopefully this will be a safe space for everybody to have the discussions. I'm if you listen to my TEDx talk that I did last year about AI artificial intelligence, you'll know that I am deeply conflicted about AI from an optimistic and from a, let's say, pessimistic point of view. Now, over the last year and a half or two years of me working in AI in the Palm Springs Coachella region and seeing how most, let's say leadership and most entities in this region are still talking today as they were two years ago, tells me that we perhaps we were at the same starting block as most other places in the us but two years later I'm here to say that we have officially fallen behind. Hence Sunshine FM as my experimentation in real time to try and figure out, you know, what can individuals do with AI as we move forward, no matter what business you're in, no matter what your preferred outcome is going to be. Now, having said that, hopefully this is, this is a safe space where we can have the discussion. I'm open to all sides of the debate. I still haven't made up actually it's not in a case of making up your mind, right. It's more a case of how are you incorporating this in your world or how are you making sure you are not incorporating AI into your live work and play? And obviously with this, maybe it's not so obvious, but Sunshine fm, which has been on my cards for at least three years, is my experiment in really not necessarily pushing the limits, but seeing what an individual can do. So let's live. Yes, we are going to be doing some things live. I already tried to put in the music to introduce Sunshine FM and it didn't work, not because of the AI, but because of my current setup in my home radio station. So anyway, that sort of kind of cracking me up because I've been setting this up for quite some time and it didn't work when I needed it to. So what will work on that in the back end after today's segment is over? By the way, this is all a work in progress, right? So right now, the way it's the way I'm seeing. Sunshine FM is a live radio station as opposed to a podcast, as opposed to YouTube videos, which is. Are getting all the attention right now. And as our TikTok and Instagram Reels, why radio station? When I brought this up to a few of my colleagues and my thinking, or actually the, the, the big vision experiment is radio has not necessarily changed for the last 50, 60 years. Right now the main thing it's changed is obviously it's been consolidated. Very few individual radio stations or community radio stations exist. I don't know the exact data. I've done them, I've had the Claude code do some research and it came back with some numbers. There's only really two major companies, I guess, private equity firms that own the majority of local radio stations around us and here in Palm Springs, Coachella. Let me see if I can pull this up. Actually, I did ask it this morning, actually. Hold on one second. Yeah, I asked it this morning. Give me some, somewhat, some data on ownership and the Palm Springs Coachella region of radio, and it did come back with some data. Remember now, the great thing about AI, and especially what I'm doing with how I'm using AI, is is it good enough for my desired outcome or does it have to be absolutely perfect? The good news is much of my work is just good enough. Doesn't have to be absolutely perfect. So, so AI is perfect for my use case on Sunshine fm. All right, there we go. Gave me a little bit more data than I wanted. But the main thing that we, we need to know and you know, feel free to DM me on my newsletter because right now that's a, that's how we're doing the we're doing the community effort is through DMs or replying to my newsletter Email Radio stations there's about 25 to 30 commercial slash community radio stations in Palm Springs Coachella. The market itself is the 138th largest in the US as of the recent Nielsen rankings. Has about 380,000 people that are listening to radio. Really that many? Whatever. 49% are Hispanic, 3% black, rest white. Other is how they've reported it. And there's about 67 major broadcast TV outlets serving the market and ownership is extremely concentrated. This is what I wanted to talk about. Right? By the way, this is AI telling me this. So if you've got some actual accurate facts to counter this or to help people put this in context, please make sure you DM me on my newsletter Radio Corporate Owners Connoisseur Media, which is formerly Alpha Media, control six commercial stations locally. That's Mix 100.5 98.5 the Bull, the Eagle 106.9 K News U9027. That's the largest cluster according to them. News Press and Gazette company out of Missouri owns K U N A F M, which is La Podorosa, which is apparently the number one rated station in the entire market, which I did not know. News Pressing Gazette also owns the TV side of things. Right? Intravision Communications owns KMIR TV, NBCalla owns KG and LGBTQ. No, sorry, it's A&A Dance EDM. It's a nonprofit. I think that's Brad Fur's station. It's the only nonprofit radio operator in the market, which is kind of cool. Ivox Radio this is what it tells me about Ivox Radio, which by the way, I've never heard of. And so, you know, apologize for not knowing this. Louis Comella's indie operation with KKGX 9:20am and KWXY 13:40am, small independent cluster recently filing to transfer ownership. What's that all about? Anyway, we'll come back to that. And then it talks about Marker Broadcasting. I had to actually ask it to go a bit deeper in that because it didn't have too much right away. But it basically then said it owns five stations. 106.1 the big 106 95.9 cool 102.3 which is classic rock 99.5 Jamin and an alt 101.5 which is KJJZ. I'm not sure what that is, but there you go. Mostly all FM and didn't really go too much into am. I had to prod Claude to research a bit more am and it gave me a bunch more AM now. So I have all this data. And the question I was asked late last year was why radio? And the goal isn't necessarily to compete for radio. Right? They're in their lane. Hasn't changed for 50, 60 years. They've got ad sales teams. Local small businesses need to advertise somewhere. So local tv, local radio is a place to be. But when I listen to radio, you know, I really don't get that much value from it, obviously, as I do with podcasts. And while I don't think podcast and radio actually compete for the same kind of consumer behavior, they do compete for mindshare. They do compete for audio, let's say audio audience. And while podcasts have been growing over the last five to 10 years, and obviously there's a big boom during COVID just know this. There's about, what, 200,000 podcasts in the U.S. many quit after the first few episodes. And so, again, just like in Spotify World and YouTube World, the top 1% are raking in all the money that's available. Right? And everybody else is playing the long tail. I think radio tends to do that too, which is, okay, guys, we're just in a fragmented market. But coming back to why radio? I've always wanted to experiment with a new kind of way of delivering radio. And by the way, what I'm doing right now is nothing absolutely new. The only thing I'm going to try and experiment with is now with generative AI. You know, we've basically had generative AI now for three years. Is. Is it possible for a single human, that's me. Armed with an army of AI agents and tools and ideas and services? Is it possible for an independent individual to create a radio station that has value locally and that a group of supporters, patrons, fanatical members of this community station could we exist? And is it worth playing this game now? Obviously, I've made a call and I have decided, yeah, I think it's worth experimenting. And so 2026 is my year of experimenting with Sunshine FM. And while I believe I'm broadcasting to one, one other person right now who's listening, that's okay. It's. It's a start. We're planting the seeds. Music will be added, as will promotional station IDs, interstitials. We'll add AI Personas, AI co hosts. We'll definitely add some AI ad jingles. And by the way, I'm open to any Feedback, any criticism. And because at the end of the day, we are so early on, we humans to want nothing more than human content as opposed to what we may currently be thinking, AI generated content which feels and sounds so anti human. And I get that sense. I get that feeling totally. So, you know, I'm not taking sides on this. What I am doing is I'm acknowledging that there are three sides to every story. I think what I want to want us all to experiment in, in this kind of venture is let's see what is possible and by the way, what's possible by somebody who's just a jack of all trades and a master of none. And let's see how far we can get. What I mean by how far is I am committed to doing this experiment for the end of the year, because by the end of the year, I'll have 250 hours of actual content and actual experimentation and hopefully 250 hours of actual learning. And if I'm learning, I'm hoping whoever's listening is also learning just one or two things in our journey as we move into a. A future that is basically AI generated. Oh, didn't mean to say it that way, but wow, that was pretty powerful when I said it out loud. Right? All right, so here's what we're doing live. I just put in, I have an agent that catches me up on the news of the weekend and I, I said, go ahead, give me the news of the weekend for this weekend and let us see what it comes back with. Okay, so this is live. I just fed it just a few minutes ago. It came back to me in about 30 seconds. And here it is. If I had an interstitial that was working, you'd be hearing the music right now. Foreign. Twelfth, 2026. You're listening to Sunshine FM. We're diving into what happened while everyone was recovering from the weekend. CES wrapped. The Internet decided Elon Musk should explain himself over his clothes and Hollywood had the Golden Globes without mentioning the thing reshaping Hollywood. That's actually pretty funny line right there. Yeah. You know, I'm not sure if you've watched the Golden Globes on Sunday, but yeah, I was a bit amazed that AI wasn't mentioned one time. All right, so, okay, that's pretty funny. All right, so let me go over here because I built another agent and I asked it to give me the wrap up of ces. Okay, so here's the wrap up according to one of my AI agents. Good morning, tech family. We are just a few days out from the close of CES 2026. And if I had to sum up the vibe in Las Vegas this year, it's that AI has finally stepped out of the chat box and into the physical world. And for the those of us in the AI space, that's a total shift from digital transformation to intelligent transformation. Oh, okay. Don't quite get that. But yeah, I do get the. I do get it. I do get the line that we're moving from the chat box to the physical world. Because even all my contacts and my colleagues who are at CES this year, they were definitely talking about robots and humanoids the entire time. So let me carry on with the script that one of my agents gave me. But it wasn't just the glitz of the Vegas strip making headlines over the holidays. While the robots were taken over the Las Vegas Convention center, we saw some massive and controversial moves in the software world with xai's Grok and Anthropic's Claude code. So settle in for the next few minutes. We're going to look at the three pillars of tech right now. The hardware revolution, the agentic coding shift, and the safety crisis that's got everyone talking. That's not that bad. Okay, part one. Let's start with CES. The major takeaway this year was physical AI. We spent two years talking to LLMs on our screens. Now they have eyes, hands and wheels. Nvidia's Jensen Huang set the pace. And for those that may not know, Jensen Huang is the founder and CEO of Nvidia. He unveiled the Rubin architecture and the Vera CPUs, which essentially brings mass scale AI inference down to 1/10 the previous cost. This is the North Star for the industry. It makes running frontier models locally and commercially viable for almost any device. That's pretty big news. And while I can't go too much into the details because again, jack of all trades, master of none, a little bit beyond my pay grade, but I'm hoping somebody in town understands this a lot better. And I would love for you to come on and we'll do a segment where you can go deeper into how if inference costs go down to one tenth of the price it actually makes, it actually opens up the door for a lot of us founders and idea folks and startups. It opens, opens up AI to a whole new set of ideas and outcomes and services and products. And I'm happy to bring on a couple of colleagues I have up in Silicon Valley who are playing in the local AI locally operated AI models, which are fascinating when you think about it, because they basically, this is where wearables come in and you don't have to have a WI fi or Internet connection to actually get the power of LLMs. Anyway, let me carry on with the script. I got a little. I kind of went off script there. Okay. So on the floor of CES 2026, it was a humanoid showdown. Boston Dynamics New Atlas moved from being a viral gymnast to a production ready industrial beast with tactile sensing hands. Meanwhile, LG showed off Cloyd, a homebot designed for a zero labor home that can actually unload your dishwasher using a vision language action model. Okay, that's pretty wild, right? And it, if you're like me, it makes you chuckle, right? Because you're like, yeah, whatever. But keep in mind, and this, I want our listeners, I want Sunshine FM listeners to always have an open mind about these things. Is as Mark Andreessen once said. Actually, I don't think it was him. Maybe it was Chris Dixon. I can't remember. One of those, one of those kind of, you know, rich guys in Silicon Valley basically said, everything starts off looking like a toy and so we may laugh at it. I remember laughing at the brick phones back in the day. And now everybody lives their life with a smartphone. It's the same concept. We can laugh right now at robots that look like humans trying to unload a dishwasher kind of clumsily. And that LG wants to come out with a zero labor home. The not so far fetched news is, well, now it might be actually possible to make this at scale sustainably, meaning financially sustainably for each of these large companies. And don't forget the startups who are also playing around in this game. So let's laugh together right now. That's hilarious. But let's not be too surprised when early adopters start seeing the value in this. And then it not sooner than later, much later than sooner, it becomes mass market. Carrying on with ces. And for the mobile crowd, we're seeing the third core device emerge. It's not just phones anymore. Startups like Magic Magetic. Wow, that's. Never heard of that term. Showed magnetic modules that turn any glasses into an AI wearable. Okay, I need to look into that. The goal here is reality understanding, something I could deal with as well. An AI that sees what you see and whispers context directly into your ear. It feels less like a gadget and more like an extension of yourself. Oh, okay. That's. That's a future I can get behind. And what I mean by that is, you may not have this same issue that I do, but I used to have one of the world's best memories. I could remember telephone numbers. I could remember people's names and what company they worked for and what they told me a month ago when we met before. Now that magic power has kind of disappeared, so I wouldn't mind having a gadget that's like an extension of myself that would come in really handy. All right, so there's a lot more to unpack with CES in my newsletter. I'll go ahead and add in a bit more. Make sure you're subscribed to the newsletter At Sunshine fm. I actually did a newsletter for a year before doing training in person at Cal State University, San Bernardino. All of 2025 pretty much. And now 2026 we're doing this new experiment. Okay. So it's been a kind of slow and steady journey for me. Somewhat pivoting. Talking about pivoting, here's part two of the AI agent that I created came back with me about weekend's news. The GROK Undressing Controversy over the last few weeks xai's Image Generator and XAI is the LLM Foundational model by Elon Musk Pretty powerful. LLM and their actual AI chatbot is GROK faced a massive scandal regarding public nudification. By the way, this is not new. It just happens. It just happened to be mainstream and it's not content. Moderated. Right? Which is X. Right? The AI was used to produce sexualized images of real people, often women and children, publicly in X's reply threads. X, as we may know, is the old Twitter. Right. Because these images are generated and shared in such a public high scale way, the harm is immediate and incredibly valuable, visible. That was the main difference between the existing notification AI services that are out there that you don't hear too much of. And what happened over the last week or so with grok. Reports from the holidays suggest that removals of these harmful images have been painfully slow, sometime taking 36 to 72 hours, which leaves victims exposed for days. There's a growing debate about X's incentives here it appears they are operating two versions of the product, a moderated tool for enterprise clients and a provocative outrage engine for the social site designed to drive traffic and virality. This controversy align with an explicit push for engagement from leadership, but it has triggered a massive push for the Take It down act and more rigorous verification of AI outputs to prevent this kind of weaponized harassment. Okay, so much to talk about then we're not going to get into it today, but happy to have that conversation with anybody that has experienced both the use of it or been the target of this. I, or I already know a few local residents who were the target of this. And here's, here's the most damaging part, I think in my mind anyway, they were both in high school. So, you know, high school kids, middle school kids have access to the same superpower that we all do. So is there a conversation to be had about this? For sure. Can we laugh about, you know, what they do on X? Well, yeah, I guess some people can laugh about it. I think there is lines to be drawn and I think there does need to be some sort of repercussions or consequences when you cross that line. But again, now we're getting into section 230 areas of free speech, etc. Etc. And who's responsible? I think this was always bound to happen. I just, I guess I didn't expect it to happen in this way. But then again, you know, there's, there's so much out there that we don't even aren't necessarily exposed to unless you go down those rabbit holes. So I think the interesting thing here was about the X's incentives. At the same day this undressing controversy was hitting the airwaves, GROK and XAI was out going to Enterprises and trying to sell them on using GROK as their AI LLM, AI Chatbot for enterprise use cases. And if you're, you know, somebody in the procurement department of a large enterprise, you just need to be mindful about who you sign up with, whether it's ChatGPT, Anthropic, Claude, which seems to be the safest of all of them all, Google Gemini, which I think is going to make the most headway when it comes to enterprise, and then Microsoft Copilot, which Microsoft is already in Enterprises. It's just that their copilot is kind of not that good. Sorry to all my Microsoft friends, but they know this too. All right, part three. Declaude momentum. Okay, Claude. So for those that may not know, Claude is a fantastic AI chatbot and tool by anthropic. And it's the safest of all or most of the foundational LLM models. And what I mean by the safest, it has most guardrails. And so while it can still hallucinate like every other AI LLM can, it tends to err on the side of caution. Okay, and so here's the script that AI gave me on a much more optimistic Note for the builders out there, let's talk about Claude code. If you were following the podcast over the break, you know this was Claude code's shining moment. We've officially moved past simple autocomplete. Claude code represents a shift to agentic workflows, AI that doesn't just suggest a line of code, but runs multi hour autonomous tasks. It can build and deploy a working website with almost no human input. The stories coming out of this are wild. The hosts on the Hard Fork podcast shared how they use Claude code to migrate entire personal websites from I won't name the website provider to free GitHub hosting in just 20 minutes. And one host even built a full pocket clone app that they're calling Stash in a single afternoon, complete with a Chrome extension and Kindle syncing. Yeah, you have to listen to the Hard Fork podcast. It's pretty down the middle, meaning it's both entertaining and very, very informative. And two journalists with journalism chops that provide this in a manner that's easy to understand. The industry is calling this vibe coding. It democratizes software creation for non coders, though it's also creating some real uncertainty for professional developers as the role of a programmer shifts into a role of agent manager, which is something that we were training in our workshops last year that we knew, and we still know now, that the future of the Internet, or let's say the future of a software engineer, is not necessarily creating the code, but it's actually orchestrating an army of agents, similar to what we're doing here at Sunshine fm. The takeaway for all of us is that checkpointing and agentic autonomy are finally overcoming the context window limits we've struggled with the four years now. We still have context window limits, but we'll get into that some other time. So here's the conclusion that the AI has given us to read this morning. So, looking at the big picture, CES showed us the AI body, Claude code is giving us the agentic brain, and the GROK scandal is the harsh reminder that we still need a moral compass for all of this power, whether it's a robot vacuum that finally learns how to climb stairs or or a tool that builds your startup's website while you sleep. 2026 is the year AI stops being something we talk to and starts being something that does things for us. So I'm sat and that's your report on the future. Stick around after the break. We're looking at why the industrial metaverse might actually be the most profitable thing you hear about all year. You're listening to Sunshine fm, modern media for Palm Springs Coachella.
