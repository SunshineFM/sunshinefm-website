Sunshine fm. Nice one. Nice one. That, that is a new track on Ronnie's follow up album. That one's about the Salton Sea. It's called Lithium Dreams. It might be called Salt and Bones. Send me a DM Satunshine fm. Let me know what you thought of it. I thought it was brilliant. Talking about lithium mining, there's a great first, the chorus is. Oh, the sea that shouldn't be pretty poison, pretty debris. That's pretty cool. So, Good afternoon. Thursday, February 12, 2026 AI is moving even more rapidly than usual. I gave you a not. I actually read out a pretty deep article yesterday called Something Big is Happening by Matt Schumer and apparently it's been mega viral. I didn't think it was. I knew 54 million was a lot. I didn't realize that basically extends the AI bubble. People. This is, this is going out into like the normies, as we call it. And if you listen to yesterday's show, you heard me, really read most of it. And if you subscribe to newsletters or websites, you'll see the transcript on there too. He was also a guest on one of my favorite podcasts. Well, one of my favorite podcasts in terms of how techno optimists would play the game. And that's okay. You need a balance. And it was the first time I actually heard him on a podcast. And while the Jordan John, who are the hosts, before he got on there, they were kind of dissing the the post, basically saying this is not like covet at all. And then kind of tearing it apart. When I read it. I didn't think he was actually saying this is like Kovid. I think he was saying, hey, mainstream people, do you remember what happened, Covid? Where everything changed, but we never saw it coming. Similar to that AI, we're going to feel as though we never saw it coming and everything's going to change. The host kind of tore it apart. But that's okay. You have many different takes on him. Anyway, he came on the show and he basically said, which I thought was pretty cool. He said he was watching the super bowl with his friends and family. And every time they always ask him, what's this AI stuff all about? He never has a good answer. And he wanted to write, he wanted to write an article for his mom and dad, for his parents to let them know, you know, I want you to get it, get in front of this. I want you to learn it and I want you to experiment with it. Because I believe this is really going to be very impactful possibly disruptive. I thought that was good. They also agreed he didn't quite, didn't quite expound on some of the topics. He should have and should have been clearer on some of them others. But overall an 8 out of 10. It obviously moved me enough to talk about it. Yesterday's show obviously relevant enough for me to continue talking about it. And it actually put a little fire into my own office chair because as I mentioned yesterday, I just feel like most of the leaders and organizations in the Coachella Valley not taking this as seriously as they should, certainly not with their actions. And so 2026, I'm going to light some fires under people's chairs. Cool. Mine My name My name is Sat Singh. I am the radio station manager and founder of Sunshine fm Modern Media for Palm Springs Coachella. I also have a fiscally sponsored nonprofit called AICV that runs in person events and workshops and boot camps. We ran about 30 of them in 2025. A lot of learning. I did not move the needle like I wanted to in the Coachella valley. Hence why 2026 is all about sunshine FM and AI co created, co generated, co produced and co broadcast in radio station. I was looking through some of my notes from late last year and I really just all I wrote was take a dream, ADD AI. See what happens. And that's what this is. Take a dream. Hey. I always wanted to own a radio station or run a radio station. All the way back from high school in San Clemente. I I did. I did a few really late night shifts where they DJ overnight. I used to work in a liquor store when I was a senior in high school when I used to stop by his radio station with a six pack of beer. I'd see what he'd go and be on about and I'd get on air once in a while. And that carried through to my college days in Claremore Men's College where a couple of my floor room roommates, they ran the local or I shouldn't say ran. They were DJs late night. This is when New wave was in. This is when punk was kind of still still around. And they used to invite me over too, as long as I brought beers from the liquor store, worked in there. So take a dream radio station, ADD AI. That's what we're doing. If you're familiar with AI, and I'm sure you are, if you're listening to this, we've got Chat, GPT, Codex, we've got Claude Code, Claude co work and Claude in general because I do like that AI model, Google, Gemini and Anti Gravity, Cursor, Vercel, GitHub, Mintlify, ElevenLabs, you name it. All the audio and text and co creative AIs we can get our hands on. Oh let's not forget to mention Whisper Flow, one of my favorites. To basically experiment in public and give Coachella Valley a homegrown center of excellence and a go to resource for all things AI. I basically live in the air bubble, if you want to call it that. And all this information that's out there in San Francisco mostly, but all over the world, it makes it here and there in Coachella Valley, but it doesn't make it impactful enough in my opinion. So Sunshine fm, Modern Media for Palm Springs. Coachella is basically bringing all the AI tech culture, media and business news updates and releases to you, right? As it happens. I'll go through some of the AI news that I run into that I find interesting. I'll share with you some of my AI conversations and meetups and events that I go to around the valley. I'll share with you maybe at some point soon we'll have interviews with local founders, local business folk, local leaders and on and have a. And have a debate. I forget the debate. Have a conversation about AI. There is no right or wrong. There's just us trying to learn this together and moving forward. I like you. I'm experimenting in real time and experimenting as much as I can. I have absolutely graduated from two years ago from just creating better prompts. The models are, I would say, close to 50 or 100 times better than they were two years ago. And with that, new understandings and new capabilities and new skills have to be in your tool belt in order for you to get the most out of working with or working alongside AI. I say alongside because I have a lot of conversations with HR people that they know it's coming. But digital employees or digital workers are going to be a reality sooner than you actually think. I mean I. I'm kind of doing myself. I'm the only human right now. I do have a. A portfolio library. I wanted to say army, but I didn't want to make it sound so militaristic. But an army of AI agents across all those models and platforms I just mentioned, some of them are better than others, some are. Some of them are better for certain tasks. And I'm trying to create a radio station that is run in the back end by an AI agent that serves as a engineer, a programmer, radio station manager, kind of me actually. Maybe DJs at some point. We have a record label, Sunshine FM Records, that has about four AI artists and bands on there right now. And again, the music you're going to hear on Sunshine FM you cannot hear anywhere else. And I think they are absolutely 100% demo ready. Keep in mind this is not a polished podcast. This is not a professional radio station. This is just a live experiment in how one human and a bunch of AI can see how we work together. All right, let's go through some of the news today actually in the last 24 hours. Why I think some of this kind of interesting Anthropic, I mean damn Anthropic can't stop winning if you know Anthropic. Anthropic is all the makers of Claude Claude AI. They came, they came from behind last year. They focused on coding and mostly enterprise. And now turning the corner into 2026, they basically took the lead. I've been talking about the CEO's papers that he's crafted and published and they are winning. So this piece of news is anthropic hits almost 20% business adoption as it gains ground on OpenAI according to RAMP's AI index released a couple of days ago, Anthropic's business adoption rate surged from 16.7 to 19.5%, making it one of the largest monthly gains since the tracking began. Meanwhile, OpenAI's business adoption slipped 36.8 to 35.9. May not sound like a lot, but when you're talking about millions of businesses, it's using it every day. It's ton an Overall business AI adoption reaches a new high of 46.8% of US businesses. Wow, that is nuts. I didn't think it was that high. But remember, this is not a one or the other. Most of my clients that I work with and what I do in my own explorations, I don't use Claude only or ChatGPT only. I use them all. So I'm presuming in the businesses they're not giving up one over the other. I imagine they're using more than one. In this article. It also says that most much of Anthropic's recent growth stems from strong reception of Claude Cowork. I actually run a bootcamp on Claude Cowork and we're getting deeper into that. We think it's pretty, pretty masterful what they're doing. And if you want to know more about what we run, what boot camps we run in the workshops, just DM me Sunshine FM and I can let you know what we're up to what is Claude cowork? It's an AI productivity tool that was unveiled January 12th a month ago today that handles routine, tough office tasks with minimal human oversight. And unlike traditional chat interfaces, coworkers autonomously executes tasks like creating spreadsheets, organizing files and drafting reports. You may have heard me talk about Claude Cowork because last week when they released the plugin for using Claude Claude code and Claude Cowork in Excel and other Microsoft tools and other financial tools, the US stock market suffered almost a trillion dollar loss in market cap in software as a service businesses. It's brought some of that back. Some investors thought it was overblown. But the uncertainty is real. The concern is real. I myself am attempting to build a radio station, or my version of a radio station by the way, using all these tools. So it's just anecdotal, but just wanted you to know. That this stuff is very important. And if you run a business or you're executive or a leader in any of the organizations in town, Let's say you're, you're reading this sort of news, but you're basically believing it's not going to affect you. First of all, you might be right. Secondly, you may be dead wrong. I'm going to save this next news towards the end because it's a feel good story or at least as a positive story. Okay, Waymo, that's, that's Google's autonomous robo taxis. Their sixth generation vehicles are going to expand across more than 20 cities and into international markets this year. The vehicles will be shipped from the US and outfitted with Waymo's autonomous technology at Arizona facility. And the company aims to exceed 1 million paid weekly rides by the end of the year, up more than 450,000 weekly trips. I wish they would keep the common denominator the same 452. No, they did. My bad. It is weekly, so they're going to basically double their rides. I've seen the cars, I've seen the Waymos. They are cool looking, there's no two ways about it. Features 13 cameras, four LiDAR units, six radars, external audio receivers and fewer total sensors than the previous generation. But with even greater capability. Waymo secured $16 billion in his latest funding round, valuing it at about 126 billion, basically doubling its valuation just over a year. It plans to move to plans to begin service in London and Tokyo, amongst other big cities. Here's a cool bit of news for me anyway is their main Waymo vehicle is called The Ojai One wonderful little township in California. Waymo is also in talks with Hyundai to supply 50,000 Ioniq 5 electric vehicles by 2028 in a deal worth approximately 2.5 billion. Hang on, 2028? I was hoping that was gonna be much, much sooner. Oh, well, what are you gonna do? So what's that got to do with AI? Right now we're experiencing AI. There's something we text or chat with. AI is being used in robotics and cars. And so while a lot of people, when I talk to them don't think it's going to be that big of a deal, basically they say it's just a tool like a calculator or a personal spreadsheet. I mean, sorry, personal computer or spreadsheet. Self driving cars are pretty much AI as well because it takes that AI brain to orchestrate everything that it's all the ins and outs, the signals in and out to make sense of it. I mentioned last week this new term that I just came across might be new to you and maybe it's old hat to you, but there was this new framing of this transition from the attention economy to the attachment economy. Where the technology is not necessarily just trying to vie for your attention, it's actually vying for your friendship, your bonding, your relationship and your attachment. So this falls into that kind of topic. Talky. It is a dumb name talk. I tree one of the nation's largest providers of in network psychiatric care announced a 210 million Series D fundraise. I get it. Telepsychiatry. And they're saying tochiatry bill. Anyway, they've got some money, they had a lot of big VCs involved in this. Then that's always a good signal. It doesn't mean that they bat 100%, but it's always a good signal when some of the big VCs get in. Unlike many telehealth competitors that rely on contract based providers, Tochiatry directly employs its psychiatrists as full time W2 employees. A model the company says ensures better continuity of care and stronger patient physician relationships. As of summer last year, the company had grown its workforce to more than 600 psychiatrists and had surpassed 2 million patient visits, basically doubling what they had a year prior. That's interesting that they're doing both human in the loop. The company treats conditions including depression, anxiety, ADHD, bipolar disorder, PTSD and OCD. And it's approved in network with more than 60 health plans. Okay, I was actually I was going to talk a little bit more about using AI as your virtual therapist. This is using AI as your virtual therapist, but is backed up by human psychiatrists. And I think that's a great thing. I don't. I looked around for the business model. I don't see it, but because it's possibly covered by a lot of health insurance, maybe it's making money out of that black box and dark secrets of health insurance and health providers, which I'm sure they're making a ton of money. Quick reminder, sunshine fm modern media for palm springs coachella. Oh, I was, I was at an event last night. And that event had about just under 20 people. I was surprised to learn. I mean, there's a lot of brain power and talent in the Valley. Folks that work at large studios in Hollywood, folks that work at large tech companies, folks that were early on with Meta and Microsoft and Google could choose to live in the Valley because of the quality of life. Right. And what I'm always preaching, which is I can't guarantee anybody out there anything in Coachella Valley except 350 days of blue skies and sunshine. That's my promise to my Bay Area colleagues. And most of them are going to be multi millionaires by the end of the year. And while it would be great to have them here, I have a feeling they're going to end up elsewhere. But I'm making my pitch. So this event I went to, one of the speakers was talking about how he is basically in an analog business. It's live performance, it's in person performance. And towards the end, the host asked him a question about AI, which is just as well because AICV was co hosting the event. Yeah, the host asked him if he uses AI and he says, oh, for sure, I use every day. Oh, what do you use it for? Oh, I use it for helping me write my songs, helping me write my programs, help me find which pieces of music would be a great fit for my, I guess they call it program, which I thought was great. That's what you want to do. You want it. You want AI to tap into expert understanding and intelligence that we may not have, even if you're a domain expert yourself. But then he also said, because, yeah, you know, he did say, well, you know, that's a. Let me get back to them. He also said that he sends out this, I think quarterly, maybe or monthly, I'm not sure, like magazine. Right. To his subscribers, I'm presuming. And he pays this local writer in the Coachella Valley. And this local writer apparently is a freelance writer for some of the magazines in town, including Palm Springs Life. He didn't mention Desert sun, but maybe Desert sun, maybe Locale, who knows? And he said that he normally gives her $5,000 for two articles for his magazine and that this year he wasn't too happy with her writing. So he turned to AI. ChatGPT gave it the prompt. The prompt came back with a bunch of ideas. He latched onto a couple of ideas. He loved it. So creative, so fun. Used AI again to rewrite that article and basically said AI was brilliant. He still gets emails to this day that says, oh, what a great article that was, what a great magazine that was, what a great newsletter. I'm not sure what it was that he actually sends out. And again, more power to everybody. That's fantastic. So then at the end, when I did ask, I said, look, there's a promise and apparel to AI and I love the fact that AI is giving you superpowers, but do you think AI is going to replace jobs in the Coachella Valley? Now, not only did he not think so, but the hosts, they didn't think so either. So we had this kind of conversation about will it want it? I obviously said I don't know, but they said they wouldn't. But then I had to. I guess I didn't have to, but I did. I asked a follow up and I said, okay, so that freelance writer that you decided not to use anymore, she's down $5,000 this month or this year. I don't know what her business model is. And if you're doing that, and let's just say half the people in this room are doing that, are those other freelance writers, are those other marketing agencies, other PR companies, are they losing their business or are they getting more business? And so we had this conversation. I don't know where it goes. I imagine marketing agencies and PR agencies and freelance writers are using AI anyway. But then the question becomes, who's actually creating the value? And what do we as professionals, white collar knowledge workers, do? If this is just anecdotally the sign of things to come, it was all good. It was all done in good form. I suddenly said, look, there's no judgment here. I'm just asking the question because I want to learn. And if it's a ladder, if people are going to be losing jobs, I'm AICV is trying to do something about this. But if you absolutely believe you are only using AI because other people are not very good at their own work, that's a different conversation. I get that. But my question to you, dear listener, is where do you see this going? What do you do for a living? And I would, I'm not going to ask the question if you feel secure in it, because a lot of people I talk to in town, they don't think AI is going to affect their work or I should say it's not going to impact their job or their position, as it were. Well, I hope you're right. Well, also when I go out there to my clients and potential clients and I see how they're implementing AI, smaller companies like, you know, small restaurants, small coffee shops, they're using it here and there and that's fine. They're going to do what they're going to do. The mid size that I deal with generally, which maybe has 200 employees or a thousand employees and even the one I was speaking to last week, which is the hospitality management company that has a thousand properties around the world. While they cannot create or develop a roadmap, a playbook, an sop, a manual for how to integrate, implement and adopt AI throughout their company, many individuals are using AI anyway. They're using it at home to do their work, they're doing it on their mobile phone to do their work, and they're emailing it to themselves because right now it's not been sanctioned or an AI model has not been given the go ahead to be used company wide. It's a thing they call Shadow AI. And Microsoft warns that 80% of Fortune 500 companies face Shadow AI security risks. That number, according to Microsoft, is about the AI agents built with low code or no code tools. But the growing gap between adoption and security is creating new vulnerabilities that could turn these digital assistants into corporate liabilities. According to the Seattle tech powerhouse, Only 47% have implemented security measures specifically designed for generative AI technologies. That was from a report and A survey of 1700 security professionals commissioned by Microsoft. Shadow AI. You may not have heard of it, you may not know anything about it, but look in your own company, take a look around, ask, make it a safe, don't be judgmental about it, Create a safe space and ask people, are you using AI? How are you using AI? What are you using AI for in your role in my company? And then also ask them, are you sharing proprietary documents, our customer data, our client records, our financials to get your work done to ChatGPT or to Gemini? You want to create. A safe space for these conversations, but you also want to allow for curiosity and experimentation within the company, not on your employees cell phones or their laptops, and certainly not on your desktop at work. Create a sandbox and create some constraints. And obviously your IT department, your CIOs should create the appropriate security and safety standards. It's some of the stuff that we train and we do boot camps and workshops on. And it always surprises me how. Folks get very defensive, not just with me and my team, but within themselves and the departments. And that's why I always, not always say, but I generally say, the technology is not the issue, it's culture, it's team readiness, and it's AI alignment. If you want to know more about those boot camps that we host than the we present, reach out to me sat at Sunshine fm and I'll let you know why it's in your best interest to think about this stuff yesterday, not tomorrow. Do you know who Demis Hassabis is? Anybody? Hello? No one? Okay. He's a Nobel Prize winning CEO of Google's DeepMind. I mean he's been playing, he's been winning chess tournaments since he was 4 years old. You should see his documentary. Nuts. He's been winning chess tournaments since he was 4 years old. He's the CEO of Google, of DeepMind, works with Google. He has predicted that artificial intelligence will usher in a new golden era of discovery within the next 10 to 15 years, transforming medicine, solving the energy crisis and potentially enabling humanity to venture beyond Earth. It describes a vision of radical abundance where AI harnesses the scientific method to tackle humanity's most intractable problems, Basically saying that AI will cure major diseases. I have no reason to doubt him. I think when I get into this conversation with folks who are either techno optimists or like the presenter the presented in Palm Desert a few days ago, who believe that AI is going to create more jobs in the valley than take away jobs. I can easily see how AI, with its exponential intelligence now and it's exponential growth of understanding and comprehension and reasoning in the future, why wouldn't it figure out all the solutions for humanity's problems? Here's the challenge. Two parts. One, it's a timing issue from 2026 to 10 or 15 years from now, let's say 2036 or 2040, you got five or 10 years where there's just chaos. It's what I call the messy middle. And when you hear the techno optimists talk about AI is going to do all this amazing stuff for humanity, I love it. I want to know what it's going to do, how it's going to affect us now and in the not too distant future. Because the second part is humans are involved in this. And I'm not saying humans shouldn't be. They should. But humans run companies, humans run governments, human run. Humans run the policies and procedures and the laws that are out there. And not everybody agrees to give AI full reign. And not everybody agrees to regulate AI safely and securely. And so when those two ideologies clash or they meet, generally the meat between those two forces are humans. And while I love Demis and what he does, I want him to also come out. Well, he won't because he's, he's, he's fixated on the future. I want his team to figure out what we humans currently are going to be doing with AI, to not only be prepared for that future, but provide for ourselves and our families. Because I think that's the, that's the chaos that's being unleashed on society. Okay, almost. Finally, I might leave you with a song, but this other piece of AI news that I think is really powerful and relevant to the Coachella Valley is this, is this tech AI startup called Wisdom. It's pre seed right now and is basically developing sensor based smart home technology for older adults. They got some money from a social impact investment program through the Richard King Mellon Foundation. So it's very early, but the whole, the whole premise is how can we use AI and this AI technology to help older adults age in place. We know that the Coachella Valley has a large percentage of aging seniors, active adults, That healthcare is one of the biggest industries in town mostly because of this aging population. And so if Wisdom can find a way using AI for folks who are older to age in place, I think that's pretty powerful. The funding right now is still going into research and development, but it's meant to provide an AI powered home monitoring system designed to help your parents live independently without cameras or wearable devices. That's the key. It was co founded by former tech executives Kathy Minter and Dawn Newsom in 2024 and basically has developed a platform that uses ambient sensors and edge computing. Edge computing generally means it's on premise to detect folds, monitor activity patterns and alert family members or caregivers when something appears wrong. And unlike traditional medical alert devices that require users to press a button, Wisdom System works passively in the background. There's obviously always going to be trade offs and one of the reasons why there's a big resistance from older adults is their invasion of privacy concerns. And they're not wrong. But I will go ahead and say this big but I spoke at the when I was speaking to the event, the folks at the event yesterday. We all pretty much agreed privacy is already gone. People have already given up their privacy. Having said that, you don't want cameras or bugs or mics listening to everything you're saying in your own privacy of your own home. Right? That's like a line too far. So what the system does is it processes the data locally on a Wisdom home hub. And uses AI powered computer vision and machine learning to identify potential falls or changes in daily routines. In collaboration with Samsung Health, It's basically coming up with calculations and equations that can clinically validate and measure risks of a fall. Now, if you don't have aging parents or you're not an aging senior yourself, just falling is one of the biggest risks. It's also one of the biggest dominoes that tips over all the other dominoes into a decline in your own health. So why is this matter? Well, not only is it cool, but it serves a big, big issue in America. United States faces a projected caregiver shortage. By 2050, the number of Americans aged 65 or older is expected to reach 82 million, up from 50 million a few years ago. And nearly 90% of adults over 65 prefer to remain in their homes as they age. So while Wisdom is targeting home care agencies, senior living communities, and hospital discharge programs. Rather than selling directly to consumers, I wonder what the shortage is of caregivers. Figure this out real quick. Caregiver shortage. Yikes. Oh, wow. There are 1.8 million job vacancies a couple of years ago. The projection just in California is about 3 million caregivers will be needed by 2030. So in about four years, we're going to need 3 million caregivers in the state of California. And why is there such a shortage? Well, low wages, high turnover, like about 50%, and physical demands caused the crisis, leaving families struggling to find care for aging parents. Here's a few stats you may already know. 10,000 people turn 65 or older daily in the U.S. what does that mean? You either turn 65 or older. Everybody has a birthday. I don't get that piece. Maybe they meant to say 10,000 people turn 65 each day in the US. The demographics? The caregiver workforce is predominantly composed of women, 80%, people of color, 74%, and immigrants, 50%. Okay, that's good to know. Did not know there was such a big crisis. So go on Wisdom. Create it. If you're doing a hub that's on premise and I have local developers who can help you bring that to aging senior centers here in the Coachella Valley as well. All right, so that's Thursday's show. I have a few more AI news updates, but we can save it for tomorrow. Reach out to Me. Do you want to talk about AI? If you are currently experimenting with AI or using AI in your business or your personal life or school, reach out tme Sunshine fm. Let's keep this conversational alive. And let me know which one of these songs, which one of our artists you're slowly forming an attachment to.
