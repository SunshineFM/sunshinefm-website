Hey,

This is Sat. Three glasses of Sancerre in and I'm still processing today's show – you know how some episodes just stick with you?

## The AI Bubble Just Went Mainstream

So that Matt Schumer piece I read yesterday? 54 million views. That's not tech Twitter anymore, that's your mom's Facebook feed. And honestly, that's what's got me wound up tonight. 

I caught Schumer on a podcast after the show, and here's what really landed: he wrote that viral piece because he was watching the Super Bowl with his parents, and they kept asking him about this AI stuff. He wanted to write something his mom and dad could actually understand. Mission fucking accomplished, apparently.

But here's what's eating at me – I'm sitting here in the Coachella Valley, watching all this unfold from San Francisco, and our local leaders are still treating this like it's some distant tech fad. 46.8% of US businesses are now using AI regularly. Nearly half! And I'm over here running bootcamps for like twenty people at a time, feeling like I'm shouting into the desert wind.

The hosts of that podcast were initially tearing Schumer's piece apart, saying it wasn't like COVID at all. But they missed his point entirely. He wasn't saying AI is a pandemic – he was saying it's going to feel like we never saw it coming, just like COVID did. One day everything's normal, next day the world's different.

## Anthropic is Eating OpenAI's Lunch

While I was prepping for the show, this stat jumped out: Anthropic just hit almost 20% business adoption, up from 16.7% in just one month. OpenAI dropped from 36.8% to 35.9%. 

You know what's wild? When Anthropic released that Claude integration with Excel last week, the stock market had a near-trillion-dollar panic attack. Software companies got massacred. Sure, some of it bounced back, but the fear is real now. These aren't just chatbots anymore – they're doing actual work.

I've been experimenting with Claude Cowork, and honestly? It's kind of unsettling how good it is at handling routine office tasks. Like, genuinely autonomous. It's not waiting for me to hold its hand through every step.

## The Attachment Economy is Here

Here's something that's been rattling around in my head since last week: we're shifting from the attention economy to the attachment economy. It's not about grabbing your eyeballs anymore – it's about forming actual relationships with you.

Take this Talkiatry thing that just raised $210 million. They're doing telepsychiatry with AI assistance, but keeping real psychiatrists in the loop. Smart move. They've hit 2 million patient visits, doubling year over year. People are forming therapeutic relationships with technology now.

And those Waymo cars? They're expanding to 20+ cities, aiming for a million weekly rides. When you're sitting in a car with no driver, having conversations with an AI assistant, that's not just transportation – that's a relationship.

## Why I'm Really Doing This

I found some notes from last year where I just scribbled: "Take a dream, add AI, see what happens." That's literally what this whole radio station experiment is.

I've wanted to run a radio station since high school in San Clemente, sneaking into the local station with six-packs for the overnight DJ. Same thing in college – my roommates would let me on air as long as I brought beer from the liquor store I worked at.

Now I'm basically a one-man operation with an army of AI agents handling everything from programming to creating original music. Those tracks you hear on Sunshine FM? You can't hear them anywhere else because they don't exist anywhere else.

But honestly, after running 30 workshops last year and feeling like I barely moved the needle, I'm getting impatient. 2026 is about lighting fires under people's chairs. This stuff isn't coming – it's here.

The thing that gets me is when people say AI is just another tool, like a calculator. Tell that to the software companies that lost hundreds of billions in market cap last week. Tell that to the psychiatrists whose patients are forming attachments to AI therapists. Tell that to the taxi drivers watching Waymo double their ridership.

Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I'm living too deep in the AI bubble. But when I'm sitting here with my glass of wine, looking at these numbers, feeling the weight of what's shifting... I don't think I am.

Talk soon,
Sat
