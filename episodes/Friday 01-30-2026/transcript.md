Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. That is Sunshine FM Modern Media for Palm Springs Coachella. This is SAT. Good afternoon. Every, every afternoon, 3pm, we're here to talk about AI tech, business and the startup ecosystems in the Coachella Valley. So what are you listening to? Well, you're listening to an experiment in AI. What you just heard. There were a couple of our initial AI artists signed to our record label. Yes, I'm calling it a record label, Sunshine FM Records. You heard Emmy and she was singing. What does she, which one did she do? Actually, both those songs about are, are about El Paseo. And if you're listening to this right here in Coachella Valley, you know El Paseo pretty well. And one song by Emmy was meeting the girls for lunch on El Paseo while she lives without Broken heart up in Stone Eagle. Stone Eagle being one of the high end country clubs in Palm Desert. And the second one was by Rani. You know her, she's our first album, Poolside Confidential. And that album, that, that song was called Rich Girls Avenue. Fun Again. Experiment in AI. I think here's a problem I'm. I set out this year, January 1, 2026 to try and solve. Attention is going to be the bottleneck it has been for the longest time. It's going to continue no matter where AI takes us. There's more information about basically everything. But let's just focus in sat, focus in to why I'm here. AI. There's more information about AI and technology and business and startups than any human can process. Podcasts, newsletters, articles, social media, Reddit. It's endless. And while I say most of it is noise, it feels like noise because it's difficult to try and make heads or tails of what the various talking heads are talking about. Right? You got folks who believe that AI is going to impact the workforce and jobs in such a disruptive manner that we don't know what the jobs of the future will be. And then on the other end, you got folks who are writing books about the age of abundance and that AI will solve pretty much all of humanity's problems and that we will have so much abundance that most of us won't even need a job because most of our needs are going to be met, obviously. Two wild thesis and ideas for the future. I did a TEDx talk last year about how conflicted I am about all this information coming from both sides and by the way, coming from everywhere too. And I think there is the promise and the peril of AI. And even I was having difficult time synthesizing the information that was like, basically coming at me like a fire hose. Now, most of it's my own fault because I subscribe to 100 AI newsletters and maybe listen to a couple of hundred. Well, I shouldn't say that many, about 50 podcasts, and. And all this information I'm taking in, it generally, I'd say 80% lives right within me, in my brain and my notes. And maybe if I'm lucky, 10 or 20% makes it out to the workshops that we did last year. In 2025, we did about 25 workshops with Cal State University, San Bernardino and a variety of other organizations in town. And I just feel it's like never ending. The news, the updates, the features, the releases, the models, the players, the funding, the data centers. Don't forget the stock market is only up because of all the investment that's going into AI. So how do you make heads or tails of this? It's difficult. I don't know. I listen to a lot of the experts. I listen to folks and who are my friends in the big AI startups in the Bay Area. I listened to my friends in Hollywood and the music industry in Los Angeles and my friends in advertising in New York and in London. And, you know, most of us really don't know. We don't know what the future is going to hold. And so when I try and find out who's doing, you know, who's taking this seriously here in the Coachella Valley, it turns out very few people. And that's why I spent the last two years trying to get the cities together to figure out we need to come together to figure out where the signal is. Didn't happen over the last two years. And that's okay. That's, you know, Coachella Valley moves at Coachella, Coachella Valley pace. And so instead of me wanting to add to the noise, I decided how can I create signal? So this is a radio station. This is not a polished podcast that you might be used to, and it's certainly not professional radio station that you might be listening to on your radio or your mobile phone. Really? Do people listen to radio and mobile phone? I don't think so. You're listening to your playlist, right? I've got something to say about playlists too, but that's for another day. And so I decided, look, radio station, it can be passive, right? It's not lean in listening. You just have it on and you're listening to it possibly in the background, possibly as you're working. And so I thought the radio Station was the way I wanted to go. And I certainly am not doing video, I'm doing audio. Because I also want you to be doing what you might be doing, whether it's working out, you're hiking, maybe you're driving, maybe you're doing the dishes and you're listening to this in between your ears, in your earbuds. But at the same time, you'd be tired of just listening to me talking, you know, know, constantly, all day, like talk radio does on AM and fm. Right. So this experiment is all about, look, I'm going to give you or I'm going to present some AI generated content. Mostly music, mostly music that is co written, co authored, co engineered, co delivered, co produced by my army of agents. I have a bunch of agents I've created over the last year or so. And some of them are just toddlers, some of them are much further along the, their learning journey, as it were. And I'm doing this because. I do believe that AI and humans have need to work together somehow. So this AI experiment is exactly that. It's an experiment on how do we work together. Now, I know there's a lot of my friends in Hollywood, I come from the music industry as well, and there's a lot of conversations to be had, you know, the good and the bad, the ugly, about how AI is creating content. And so this is an open invitation. Anybody who's got an opinion about AI in general or AI in music or the recording industry, DM me, let's get on the show, let's talk about this. This is, you know, I want to learn from other folks who are much smarter than me, but in order for a one person radio station to exist, what I'm doing is I'm actually creating a record label. And the record label has a bunch of AI artists and those AI artists are creating a whole bunch of songs. Couple of things about those songs, one, you're not going to hear them anywhere else. And some of you might be saying good. Some of you might be saying, oh, okay, that's kind of interesting. You're not going to hear these songs anywhere. They're only played on Sunshine fm and they're only generally written about the Coachella Valley, about living and working in the Coachella Valley, you know, the good sides and the not so good sides. And I found that kind of interesting. Back in the day. You put your team together, you know, you, you wrote songs, you made demos, you had the studio, you brought your team, your band together, your engineer, your producers, your, your agents who give you notes and you spend days, if not weeks in the studio crafting something pretty powerful and what you'd hope was going to be powerful picked up by a record label, right. Or you wrote songs and you, you know, sent them into other singer songwriters to cover what I'm finding with AI, most of the songs that you're going to hear, they're demo ready. Absolutely. Are they professional to be on the radio or be with a record label? I'll leave that to you to make that judgment. But demo ready AI, it's here. And that's what you're going to hear most, you know, when we get to 24 7, you're going to hear it pretty much, you know, all the time. Now, having said that, I also want you to have a radio station that I've always wanted too, which is, yeah, entertain me with some music. But if you're going to interrupt, interrupt with something that elevates me, makes my brain kind of sharpen, lets me understand the world a bit better. And the world that I want to focus in on is AI, technology, business and the startup ecosystem, broadly speaking, and how that impacts us here in the Coachella Valley. So, yes, I have a 3pm daily weekday talk show, which is what you're listening to right now. But throughout the day you'll get interruptions in the hours about any sort of AI related release or news or update that I think might be very interesting if you're running a business locally, if you're trying to get into AI, if you're in school, if you're trying to figure out what, how AI is going to impact you and how you can go ahead and make the most of it. Sunshine FM is your radio station of choice. Remember, just an experiment. So that's the show. There's no stock tickers, there's no hype cycle, there's basically content that you're not gonna be able to find anywhere else. I do synthesize a lot of this information that I take in and I try and surface usually some sort of common thread that goes through the day's show, or at least you know, the flagship kind of show. And as I mentioned before, if you hear me say the word we, that's because it's me and, and an army of AI agents, assistants, tools, automations, call them what they what you want. This is the year of the agent, so just get used to that term. And I'm doing this right now with a combination of using Claude AI, I'm using Chat GPT's foundational model, 5.2, I'm also using Google, Geminis, Flash 3, and a variety of other tools and services built on those foundational models. So if you know what I'm talking about, Yay. If you don't DM me or just keep listening to the show, happy to get you on board this spaceship. So this is Sunshine fm Modern media for Palm Springs Coachella. Again, not a polished podcast and not a professional radio station. We. We're just swimming against that grain. I just feel modern media needs to be. Needs something different. And while I think this needs to exist, I'll leave it to you as the audience and community members to support it and to let me know either directly DMing me or just tuning in. I'm not tuning in, I guess, is what it really comes down to. Right, so here we go. I've got a bunch of great little stories that happened over the last 24, 48 hours in the world of AI, there is a thread through them and I'm also attempting something new here. Here we go. You are listening to Sunshine fm. Modern media for Palm Springs Coachella. Sunshine fm, Sunshine fm. You are listening to. Okay, that was my station id, interstitials, I guess is what they call them in between. Every time you hear that, I'm just changing a topic. Okay, all right. So you heard me talk this week about Claude Bot. So here's the. There's the. There's the backstory, right? If you blinked this week, you missed the weirdest ride in AI, a viral open source assistant, a naming dispute, and then a crypto scam. Let me quickly give you some backstory on this. The open source project blew up under claudebot Saturday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday. It had to change its name from claudebot to Maltbot because Peter the. The actual. Who is it? Peter. What's his name? Peter Steinberger. Okay, so here's what we'll do. This story is about a project called OpenClaw. It's an open source AI assistant you run on your own computer, not on Google or OpenAI's Cloud. It hooks into your everyday apps like WhatsApp and Telegram, meaning you get a personal AI assistant that follows your rules. In just one week, it got over 100,000 stars on GitHub and 2 million million visitors. Yes. Took the Internet world in the air, world by storm. There was a naming drama this week. It was originally called claudebot. C, L, A W, D, B, O, T. It was a pun on the AI. Claude with a claw. Okay, yeah, you're an audio. You may not get that if you Were reading it, you would understand it. So it's on me to do a better job. Anyway, Peter, the developer, thought it would be fun to have a pun if AI agents had a claw, right? So it was a lobster themed. Agent, the company behind Claude Anthropic, which is one of the models I use, politely asked the developer, Peter Steinberger, to change it due to trademark issues and confusion. He quickly renamed it on Monday to Maltbot because again, he has a sense of humor and he felt that a lobster, when it's growing, it molts its shell. But over this week, over the last four days, users hated the name. By the way, I did not know this last night. I woke up to this news this morning. So as of this morning, it has rebranded again to Open Claw. Now that's a pretty good word. I mean, I think it's pretty good. Three brand names in seven days. Okay. The other reason why he changed it to OpenClaw is if you've been in crypto, you know that scammers basically right away jump on any trending topic. And so when he abandoned his old handle, the crypto folks immediately snatched up the old handle, impersonated the project, and launched a fake cryptocurrency called $claude C L A W D. Investors who thought it was official pumped the coin to 16 million dollar market cap before it crashed to pretty much zero. Ouch. The bottom line, OpenClaw is now the fastest growing open source project in the world. Basically proves people are hungry for privacy, focused AI that big tech doesn't control. But the scam and some security leaks show the dangers of moving this fast in the wild, wild, wild west of AI development. If you've downloaded Claude and you're here in Coachella Valley dme, let's talk about your experience and how things are going for you, what you built, if anything. I think inquiring minds need to know. You're listening for Sunshine fm. Modern Media for Palm Springs Coachella. You're listening for Sunshine fm. I still can't get that right. That's okay. We'll get it. Okay, headline, Google's Genie out of the bottle. Okay, so yesterday, Thursday, January 29th, Google launched Project Genie, a powerful new AI tool that lets users generate playable 3D video game worlds just by typing a text prompt. It's powered by Google's new Genie 3 model, and it's expensive. Available only to subscribers of the AI Ultra tier Gemini, which costs $124.99 a month. Now, it's not kind of pricey for experimentation but you'll soon see pretty cheap if you're developing games, because the promise was endless creativity. The reality, however, was that there was a massive copyright infringement. So here's the scoop. The Verge got early access and discovered the tool had virtually no guardrails against copying famous video games. Jay Peters, the reporter he typed in descriptions of a plumber in a red hat and he got a playable world that looked and felt exactly like Super Mario 64. He also described a fantasy landscape and the AI generated a character that didn't just look like Link from the Legend of Zelda. It moved like him. So how did this happen? Google confirmed that the AI was trained on, in quotes, publicly available data from the web. Basically, the AI watched millions of hours of YouTube gameplay videos and it didn't just learn what Mario looks like, it learned the physics of how he jumps and how things are structured by watching streamers play the games. So when they were confronted yesterday, Google product manager Diego Rivas called it an experimental research prototype and that they are listening to feedback. And unlike Disney, whose characters like Mickey Mouse and Sora were already blocked from from the system at launch, Nintendo seems to have been overlooked. So Google has hastily updated the tool this morning so that if you try and generate Mario related words, you get a content provider interest error instead. Nintendo has not filed a lawsuit, but with Google charging $125 a month for a tool that can rebuild Nintendo's products on the fly, there's a strong possibility a massive settlement or a big law suit is inevitable. You are listening to Sunshine FM Modern Media for Palm Springs. Okay. Kind of getting better. Okay, this is a pretty good story sticking with video games. If you know, if you follow the video game industry and I was in the mobile, mobile games industry back in the day, sold a games library andstudio to king.com the makers of Candy Crush Saga. So we used to go to E3 in Los Angeles constantly. Fantastic conference every June. Fantastic games conference. So if you following the games industry, you know that for the last few years, generative AI has been the main massive buzzword, just like in most industries. And executives have promised it would revol revolutionize how games are made. But a new report dropped this week shows that people actually making the games are turning against it and hard. The games Developer Conference that's up in San Francisco. Yeah, please. So GDC released their 2026 State of the Game Industry report in which they surveyed 2300 developers. And right now 52% of developers believe generative AI is actively harming the industry and the reason why this is news is because just two years ago that number was 18%. Basically the optimism has clapped collapsed and only 7% of respondents think the tech is having a positive impact. That is interest. Interesting. There's a. They believe. The report believes there's a massive divide between the suits and the creatives. On the one side you have business managers and executives. They are adopting these tools quickly, just like a lot of businesses that we consult with. Although this, this number is pretty high. They say nearly 60% of these executives are using AI in their workflows. I don't know. I mean, I think people who use AI to write emails, they would answer a survey that says, yeah, I'm using AI in my workflow. So 60% don't think of this as like agentic work processes. I can't imagine that's happening because even my own experience with my clients is they are so far from those work processes that they, that they feel comfortable giving over work processes to agentic automation. And so on the other side, this is similar to Hollywood, right? You have the artists, the narrative designers and the programmers. They are overwhelmingly negative about it. The report includes anonymous quotes from developers that are heartbreaking. One said, I have to use it, otherwise I will be fired. Another simply said, I'd rather quit the industry than use generative AI. I hear this from my Hollywood friends. I mean, in all honesty, two years ago they were definitely against it. Two years later, I'm not so sure they're coming around to it. But I think the reality is hitting that. What, what can you really do with AI invading your industry? Maybe the video game industry is the same. So basically this is not just about artistic integrity, it's about survival. This anti AI wave is happening during a brutal time for the game industry. The survey found that 28% of these workers have been laid off in the last two years. I have a story coming up next week about some layoffs in the tech world. I mentioned it earlier this week with Amazon, but there's a deeper dive coming next week, so stay tuned. So when you combine mass layoffs with the technology that management loves, workers are terrified that they are training the replacements. Wow, that is powerful. The reason why? Because it sure feels like that on the ground. It was done in some tech companies and I think I mentioned this last week. If you're using AI just to help your bottom line and replace humans, that may not be sustainable. I don't know the answer. My hope is that you watching and listening to this AI experiment building in public, that I can prove that there's ways that AI and humans can work together to hope, not hopefully to provide something of value that we can then help your own economic wellness. Students trying to enter the games industry are citing AI displacement as a major fear. Okay, so to be fair though, the report shows that most developers currently using AI aren't using it to generate final art or code. Same as me. I don't use it for final, I co create it with AI. About 80% are using it for boring stuff, research, brainstorming and Excel formulas, mostly using tools like ChatGPT and Gemini. And by the way, if you listen to my show early this week, Claude AI came out with their integration with Excel and that if you haven't played around with it and you are an Excel super user or you want to be, I have somebody in town that is an Excel expert and she can help you integrate some of this AI natural language with Excel. Okay, so just DM me. I'll be happy to make the introduction. Going back to the video game world, the trust seems to be fading. We recently saw this with a studio called Larian Studios, the makers of Baldur's Gate 3. They faced immediate backlash from fans just on the rumors that they were using AI for prototyping. So what's the takeaway? The takeaway is this. The honeymoon phase for AI in gaming is officially over as the industry heads to San Francisco for the GDC Festival this March. I was right. The conversation has shifted from look at this cool new tool to is this technology destroying our jobs? Wow, there's a lot to unpack there. Because it's not just the games industry, right? Obviously it's Hollywood. I was on a call this morning with the Journalism association and while a couple of a couple of observations, local journalism has been on a decline for the for the longest time since media has been consolidating in the US for the last 10, 15 years. And so the broader efforts by media in general who maybe can afford AI tools and services and consulting doesn't trickle down to local journalism. Local journalism is left to academic support. It's left with nonprofits and grants and journalism grants to keep the citizens informed. And at the end of the day, if you're a non profit or you're relying on nonprofits, your business model is always year to year going to your funders with an open hand. Right? With a hat in hand is the term. And so my observation this morning was I'd mentioned culture change and new business models and unfortunately I'm either speaking a foreign language or it's too, let's say, vague, esoteric for folks to kind of have that conversation. And what I noticed for the hour long conversation that I was with, with the community, with the association was they're just basically doing business as usual. I don't mean that in a bad way. I just mean they're busy. They're busy trying to report and they're busy trying to edit and they're busy trying to publish and they're busy trying to do getting advertisers and sponsors. They're busy doing what local journalism, local media outlets tend to do on a daily basis. And I live in an AI bubble and I look at how can AI not be a bolt on, but how can AI actually disrupt your business model in the way we do business? Again, I may be so off base, but it's a little bit, I wouldn't say frustrating. I've been working with them for over a year, so I know how slow, even associations work. So they have also been talking. They're also, you can tell that they're shifting to is this technology going to take away our local journalism jobs? You're listening to Sunshine of them Modern Media for Palm Springs Coachella. You're listening for Sunshine fm. Modern Media for Palm Springs Coachella. Yeah, just bear with me. I, I'm having wonderful challenges with my agent. Agent, please follow my instructions. All right, so I'm presuming a lot of you are listening are actually already using ChatGPT and the news today was, well, if you're using Chat GPT, more than likely you're using Chat GPT 5.2. I say that purely because today OpenAI officially announced that on February 13, 2026, they are retiring the G GPT 4O model. Now, if you're in the AI bubble, there is some backstory to that which I will get to. But what this marks is the end of the road for one of the most popular and controversial AI models we have seen to date. The backstory is this. People loved it. 4o was launched in May 2024 and it was a game changer back then. Not just because it had this AI smarts, but because it was one of the first models that came out that felt, and I'm putting this in quotes now, human. It had warmth, personality and a conversational style that made it perfect for creative writing or just brainstorming what I tend to do, thought, partner, co creativity. And for a lot of users it wasn't just a tool, it was a favorite collaborator. So then the drama and we, we spoke about this when. When the news broke last summer in our workshops, the revolt of August 2025, it was the first time OpenAI had tried to retire this model. So about five months ago, they attempted to remove it and replace it with their newly released GPT5. And the backlash was immediate and intense. Users rallied on social media with the hashtag 4o, arguing that the newer smarter models felt cold and robotic compared to their favorite. People had genuinely attached themselves emotionally to the way GPT4O spoke. And the outcry was so loud back then that OpenAI actually reversed their decision and brought it back, promising to give plenty of warning next time. So why is it ending now? Oh, by the way, yeah, that made sense. Good PR move. So why is it ending now? Why kill it now? Well, according to OpenAI, the numbers just don't support keeping it alive anymore. And when I saw this number, I was like, what? Really? Daily usage of GPT4O has dropped to about 0.1%. What? Really? Nobody's using it. I mean, I know once in a while I'll go back and go to a legacy model because you can get different results for the same query or the same kind of back and forth brainstorm. Because sometimes you're, if you're having a conversation with your Chat GPT or your Google GPT Gemini, they can get stuck in a little bit of a loop. And yes, you can start a new thread depending on your memory settings in your AI of choice, it may still get stuck. But what can can help actually is not necessarily starting a new thread, but selecting a new model. And what I'll sometimes do with ChatGPT is I'll go back and, and select a legacy model like 4O to see what kind of answer it may give me. So this 0.1%. Oh my God, that is. It's tough to believe. I must be. Obviously I'm part of that 0.1%. The vast majority of people have moved on to chat GPT 5.2, which is faster and more capable. So much for the outcry last summer, right? Open AI says make maintaining these older legacy models takes resources away from making the new ones better. Okay. And to soften the blow, they have added new features to the current models that let you adjust the personality and warmth, specifically trying to replicate the vibe users missed from 4.0. If you, if you're not a power user or if you don't look under the hood, there are a lot of settings in check chatgpt that you can go in and adjust their personality, there's some preset personalities. There's also ways of giving it instructions to tell, to tell it how you want it to respond, in what format and what tone. So there's ways of customizing that conversational tone. The retirement date is set for February 13th. Yep. The day before Valentine's Day. They're, they're retiring an AI model or they're breaking up with an AI model that people love the most. So bottom line, if you've, if you still love using GPT4O, you have until the 13th to say your goodbyes. I mean, literally, I think people will be saying goodbyes and screenshotting their conversations to social media. I have a whole new focus this year about AI companionship. What it means for teenagers and what it means for parents and what it means for elderly and let's say, aging population. Again, just like with most things, AI, the promise and the peril of AI companionship is something I've been doing a ton of research, research on for the last year. And it's something I think I may want to hang my head on, hang my hat on when it comes to being the expert in something in AI AI companionship. Okay. This is right up my alley because people are connected to their AI companions. You're listening for Sunshine fm, Modern Media for Palm Springs Coachella. Oh, that was much better. Much sweeter, much softer. Finally, before I go into a little bit of a local news, if you followed the AI boom in any way, shape or manner, whether it's just investing or watching the stock market, just read the headlines in the news or actually deep into the AI rabbit holes with the rest of us here, you know, it's, the race has been intense. I mean, two years ago and all last year it was leapfrog after leapfrog after leapfrog. I kind of missed those days. Those were kind of energetic, fun, oh my goodness kind of days. Well, according to the latest report, it's going to get a bit more expensive because what we're looking at in 2026 could be the biggest IPO in history. OpenAI is reportedly preparing to go public by the end of this year, and they're targeting sometime in the fourth quarter of 2026. Christmas presents. Here's the quick backstory. So for the last two years, it's basically been a two horse race between OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, and its rival Anthropic, the creators of Claude. Both companies have been staying private while burning through billions of dollars to build smarter models. The public part of this race kicked off recently, when we learned that Anthropic had hired the law firm Wilson Sonsini to prepare for its own ipo. I talked about this like a couple of weeks ago, a couple of show two weeks ago. That move signaled that they were ready to tap into the stock market to fund their massive computing costs. OpenAI essentially had to respond to ensure that they didn't get beaten to the punch. Now look, I'm not a big stock market guy. I don't know the public markets. All I know is there's only so much money to go around. And if the private investors in OpenAI and Anthropic, if they want to go public this year, it's not just because they're trying to raise money, is because if they wait any longer and if the economy gets softer, there may not be as much public retail demand for them to cash out like they want to. Again, not a stock guide. This is not financial advice. That's just my kind of gut feeling having been there, done that in various other tech technological booms. So this week OpenAI shifted into high gear. They are not just talking about an ipo, they are building the infrastructure for it. So here's what they've done. They're locking down the money. Reports indicate that OpenAI is chasing a massive funding round of up to $100 billion. They are in talks with Amazon for a potential $50 billion investment. And SoftBank is looking at adding another 30 billion which in addition to what they've already committed to. Second, they are fixing their back office. You cannot go public without a rock solid finance team. Their CFO, Sarah Fryer, who joined the company back in June 2024, just hired a new chief Accounting officer and a head of corporate finance. Veterans you hire when you need to convince Wall street that your books are clean. Hey, WeWork, are you listening? The numbers we are seeing are astronomical. OpenAI is currently valued around $500 billion. And if this recent rounds of funding. You know this just came back from Davos and this new news yesterday about Amazon also wanting to invest. Remember Amazon actually is like a shareholder of Anthropic, so that's kind of strange. If this fundraising goes through, the private fundraising, that valuation when it goes public later this year could spike to $830 billion. That's a trillion dollar IPO. Nuts. And by the way, we're not Even talking about SpaceX and what they're supposed to go public this year too. There is. You got to look at the. Don't get caught up in this hype, okay? This is not financial advice. But just remember their costs of doing business are pretty high. Projections right now show the company could lose 14 billion in 2026 and they aren't expected to turn a profit until the 22,030s. Meaning the investors are betting purely on future dominance, not current cash flow. So this is not a no brainer. The clock is ticking. With Anthropic valued at roughly 350 billion and also eyeing a 2026 listing, we are set for a showdown later this year. Whichever company lists first could set the top tone for the entire AI market. But for now, OpenAI is staffing up and cashing up to make sure they win the debut. Like I said, I woke up this morning with that news. It wasn't too surprising. The valuation wasn't that surprising either. They have 800 million weekly active users. They are a brand, household brand name when it comes to AI tools. Really comes down to the state of the economy. Which is it? The economy on the street or is it Wall street economy? If the Wall street economy is still singing when they go public in, let's say, the fourth quarter, I imagine they'd wait until the midterms are over. The midterms are going to be, oh my goodness, what can I say? This is not political show, so I won't get into it. But it most probably right after the midterms. And therein is such another under undercurrent conversation about tech and politics. But this is not the show for that. Oh my goodness, who knows, Will they get that valuation or will it be a dud of an ipo? If you have any thoughts about this, DM me, let's talk about this. Obviously, as we get closer and closer, this will be louder and louder. And I'm happy to keep the conversation going because I think the way the retail markets react to how OpenAI does or anthropic does on the stock market will give a halo or a dampening effect to AI experimentation, AI funding, AI integration. And that's not a bad thing either way, right? I mean, if it goes off like a rocket ship, everybody's going to have FOMO and they're going to want to, they're going to want more AI tools in their own companies, in their own ventures. If it doesn't go as well, people can catch their breath. And that's not necessarily a bad thing for us normies in the real world. Okay. You are listening to Sunshine FM Modern Media for Palm Springs Coachella. Sweet. That one worked well. All right, so two things I said. This is not a political show. It's not. But there's reality to it. It is fun. We're gonna have a lot of fun with Sunshine FM Modern media for Palm Springs, Coachella. If you're interested in any of these topics and you and also if you're actually integrating or playing around with experimenting with AI music or AI content audio, obviously, DM me and let's get on the show. Let's talk about it. If you're in high school, you're in college, you're an entrepreneur, you're a career switcher, you're retired. I get a bunch of emails constantly about people wanting to know more about AI and how they can go ahead and get either intro AI. I get less about the folks that want to, like, go next level because I'm not sure if we have that kind of culture here, but maybe we do. We're going to try and surface it. Most importantly, Sunshine FM is your AI signal for Coachella Valley. I want to leave you with two songs. One is a what we call a diss track about all the two things. One, about all the high rise or tall buildings that are being approved in Palm Springs and the outcry from the citizens. It's based on the report that we learned a couple of weeks ago about the convention center getting its 125,126 million okay from measure J along with the Nexus Hotel. And there was a lot of outcry from Palm Springs residents about that whole deal. And then after that, I'm going to follow up with just to end the week with my take on a protest song on what's happening in Minneapolis. Have a great weekend. DM me. Happy to chat. We'll talk next week. Here.
