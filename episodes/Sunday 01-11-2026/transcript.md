Yeah, I think we're on. Hello, world. Today is January 11th. The time is 1:11. You're listening to Sunshine FM. This is SAT, and this is an experiment. Sunshine FM is modern media for Palm Springs Coachella. It's about AI startups, business, culture, entertainment and ideas. But mostly it's about curiosity. I've loved radio my whole life. I did some of it back in high school at K Wave in San Clemente. So go Tritons. I djed a few overnight slots at Claremont Men's College. Go Stags. And I spent a ton of time in the record industry and Hollywood in Los Angeles. I'm not a dj. I'm sure you can tell I'm an okay musician. I've never worked in radio. I just love radio. I just love the business of radio, and I just love how radio fits into our lives. And as a founder, this station is something I've always wanted to build. And what's different now is AI. This era of AI promises so much, and for the first time, it actually feels possible for one human. That's me, armed with an army of agents, tools and ideas to try and build a modern media brand in public. Now, here's the thing. It won't be polished. It'll be far from perfect. This is certainly not a podcast, and it's certainly not a professional radio. This is just an experiment. Some of this will be fun, most of it will be weird, and much of it will actually be serious, because the changes that AI brings to how we live, work and play are very, very real. So without going on and on about AI, just know this is an open experiment. We're building in public, we're learning as we go. And by the end of this year, let's see where AI has taken all of us. And by the way, when I say we, I mean me, a human, and an army of AI agents, assistants, Personas, co hosts, engineers, producers, salespeople, operators, GMs, station managers, you name it, all those talents and skills that are needed to run a real radio station. Can I individually do that with AI? Anyway, there's so much more to come from AI generated music, AI generated jingles. But for today, this is purely me placing a marker in the sand with an experiment that together will run all year long. And if you're listening, thank you. You already part of it. So, as I sign off this opening stanza, here's the tagline. You are listening to Sunshine fm, Modern media for Palm Springs Coachella. That wasn't bad. I think right there, we put some music right all right, sweet.
