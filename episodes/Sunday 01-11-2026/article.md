# Local Intelligence: Hello World — SunshineFM Launches

**January 11, 2026 — SunshineFM Local Intelligence Report**

This is us broadcasting. This is our Hello World moment.

On Sunday, January 11, 2026, at 1:11 PM PST, SunshineFM went live from a home studio in Rancho Mirage. The timing was intentional—1-11 at 1:11. A mnemonic. A proof of concept. A signal to everyone listening: we're alive, we're kicking, and we're experimenting.

## The New Internet: AI-Native Media Launches

This is the birth of a radio station built entirely on the assumption that one human plus an army of AI agents can create something worth listening to.

SunshineFM isn't a polished podcast. It's not professional radio. It's an experiment in what happens when you combine:
- One person's curiosity and taste (me)
- Multiple AI assistants and agents
- Music generated entirely by AI
- A commitment to being a safe space for conversations about AI's promise and peril

The technical stack is visible. The machinery shows. The seams don't hide. That's the point.

## Local Intelligence: Building a Media Brand for Palm Springs Coachella

Here's what matters locally: SunshineFM is designed to be the daily signal source for how AI and the new economy are reshaping work, life, and business in our region.

Most media covering the Coachella Valley talks about real estate, hospitality, festivals, or tourism. SunshineFM is talking about something different: What does it mean to build a life or a company here in the era of AI? Who's experimenting? What's possible? What's the threat?

Broadcasting at 11:11 AM PST, Monday through Friday, the format is simple:
- Local signal and business news from the Coachella Valley
- Analysis of how global AI shifts apply locally
- Music, jingles, and sonic experiments created by AI
- Real conversations with entrepreneurs, founders, and curious people

## Community Comments: Why This Matters

If you're considering your next chapter—whether it's a business relocation, a company build, or simply a shift in how and where you work—you have many choices around the country. SunshineFM exists to make one clear statement: Palm Springs Coachella is a legitimate option.

Not because of the weather or the golf courses (though both are real). But because something interesting is happening here with technology, business, and people willing to experiment.
