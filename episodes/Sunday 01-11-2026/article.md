HEADLINE: Sunshine FM: The Radio Station Built by a Human and an AI Army
---
January 11th, 1:11 PM. A precise moment to mark a new beginning. This isn't just another radio station. This is Sunshine FM, a modern media brand designed for Palm Springs and Coachella, and it's born from an experiment. Forget everything you know about traditional broadcasting. Here's the premise: one human, me, armed with an army of artificial intelligence, is building this in public, right here, right now. You are witnessing the launch of something different, unpolished, and intensely curious.

I've loved radio my entire life. Not just passively. I spent time behind the mic in high school at K Wave, and again at Claremont Men's College. Later, I delved deep into the record industry and Hollywood. You might expect a founder to tell you they're a seasoned radio professional. I'm not. I'm an okay musician, maybe, but I’ve never worked in radio. My connection runs deeper: a fascination with the business of radio, how it weaves into our lives, and the sheer audacity of creating something from scratch. For years, I've wanted to build a media brand like Sunshine FM. Now, there's a fundamental shift in the landscape that makes this dream not just possible, but imperative: AI. This technology promises to transform industries, and for the first time, it feels within reach for a single individual to tackle a venture of this scale. You don't need a huge corporation anymore; you need a vision and the right tools.

This is where the experiment gets truly interesting – and frankly, a little weird. When I say one human, I mean one human. When I say an army, I mean a legion of AI agents, assistants, personas, co-hosts, engineers, producers, salespeople, operators, general managers, station managers. Every talent and skill required to run a real radio station? I'm attempting to manifest it through AI. This isn't some abstract concept; it’s a living, breathing demonstration. We're building in public because transparency is paramount, and because the learning curve is steep. This won’t be polished. It will be far from perfect. It's not a podcast, and it’s certainly not professional radio in the traditional sense. It's a real-time laboratory for what modern media can become. Some of it will be fun. Much of it will be strange. All of it will be serious, because the changes AI brings to how we live, work, and play are undeniable. Sunshine FM is a tangible example of those changes unfolding.

This journey is set to run for the entire year. By December 31st, what will Sunshine FM be? What will we have learned about the capabilities of AI when paired with human intent? What new forms of media will emerge from this fusion? By simply listening, you are already a part of this unfolding narrative. You're witnessing the raw, unadulterated construction of a future-forward media brand. The implications stretch beyond just music and news; they speak to the very nature of creation, entrepreneurship, and community in an AI-powered world. So, tune in. Observe. Question. By the end of this year, we’ll all see where AI has truly taken us.
