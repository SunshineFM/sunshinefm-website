Sunshine fm, Modern Media, Palm Springs Coachella. Good afternoon, Good afternoon, Good afternoon. Today, what is it? Thursday, February 5th. Mark this date on your calendars. February 5th, 2026. If you're in the AI world, big day. Why? Because OpenAI and Claude Anthropic Claude just released major updates to their flagship models. So we're going to get into that a lot more, get deep, dive into that because I think it's pretty important and it's, I want to say, setting the tone for 2026, but I will say, oh my goodness, 2026 is going to be a really profound and crazy year in a lot of different manners. But I'm going to stick with AI business startups, what it means for Palm Springs Coachella and how this new technology and basically this new plate tectonic shift in how we live, work and play is going to basically shake up everything we do locally. I'm sat, I'm the. What's my title? Program manager. I think I was station manager last week, right? Yes, Program manager. Station manager here at Sunshine fm. Sunshine fm Modern Media for Palm Springs Coachella is an experiment in how AI and humans could possibly work together as we go barreling into this future that really most of us have no idea of how disruptive and chaotic it might be from a technological point of view. If you've been listening so far this year, 2026, I've had quite a lot of shows and we've talked quite a bit about the foundational models. I also talk about how some smaller models or smaller AI services are also really beneficial to you if you're a small business owner in town and how, how you as a business owner, as a manager, a who oversee, let's say a small staff, mid size or large staff. How do you make the most of this pretty brilliant technology when there was no owner's manual that came with it? You know, we were, we were given this, a pretty powerful set of tools and no training. This profound new. I guess it's more than software. I wanted to say software, but it's more than software. Profound new technology and given no education, nobody telling you how to do it, and especially nobody in town, right, except those cool people over at AICV. If you've heard of AICV, you can go to their website aicellavalley.com and aicellavalley.org where they basically do responsible, ethical, mindful kind of understanding of the pros and cons of AI. There is a peril and there's a promise with AI and the Folks at AICV have been doing workshops. In 2025, I think we did about 20 workshops with Cal State University San Bernardino at their entrepreneurial Resource Center. And I myself with AICV did another like 10 or 12 presentations at the chambers, at the, a couple of organizations in town and in Riverside. And so that whole year, last year, great learning from for us in terms of we were training and we were bringing all these new tools to the fore. There was also a great understanding and learning from how small business owners and entrepreneurs and folks from the larger tech companies who are remotely working here, how they were also reacting to and implementing AI. I'm telling you, a year ago in January of 2025, I would say people were kind of coming around to AI, but most of them just didn't want much to do with it from the point of view it is disruptive to your business model. A year later, here's the pro and con. They're still talking the same game. It's just one year's worth of them playing around the chat bots and chat GPT and maybe Grok, maybe Google, Gemini. And so they're seeing some of the fun, novel, novelty aspects of it. And I think the business people are taking this seriously. They're, they're definitely trying to put workflows, automations. I've seen that myself. But here's what's happening is they're, they're bumping into walls and they're bumping into really, at the end of the day, not just technical issues because, you know, the promise of AI is you don't have to be technical to do what software developers used to do. I think we're still a ways away from that, but it's coming sooner than you think. The other, to me, the more important piece of what I'm seeing when I go out and consult with the brands and the businesses in town is it's a cultural issue, is there are plenty of people who don't want anything to do with AI for various reasons, from fear of losing a job to I have to learn another technology or another software is it. And when they do use it, does it just add more work to their workload? All the way to folks who are really optimistic about it and really enthusiastic about it. But when both those camps live within the same umbrella of a corporation or a company or a small business, the real bottleneck is trying to get everybody aligned, culturally aligned and North Star aligned and to create a safe space where everybody feels like their fears or their enthusiasm is heard and can be Acknowledged. And I think that's what we do at AICV and at Sunshine FM where we create this safe space for the conversations, discussions. There is no right or wrong, although I am pretty opinionated and I will go ahead and give my take on every news story that comes around for AI and business and technology and the startup ecosystem. But once you can create that safe space within your company, I think that's when you can start figuring out where and how do you implement which models, which services, which solutions, which are AI solutions do you bring back or do you put into your company? Now if you don't have CEO buy in, it's not going to go anywhere. If you don't have an AI counsel or an AI individual who's the go to person, it's not going to go anywhere. And if you don't have this safe space set up where everybody's listened to and heard, I'm here to tell you been doing this for two years now, it's not going to go anywhere. It's going to be short lived, let's put it that way. So talking about existing softwares that you already pay on a monthly basis, you know, you know some folks pay a few hundred dollars a month for this stuff, some people pay a few hundred thousand dollars a month for this stuff. I bring this up because of our first AI news story of the day is actually more of a general business story but it's pretty profound. I mentioned it yesterday and it's this stock market sell off this week. From Us Software 7 days running now and when I mentioned this in the stories earlier this week we were at about $285 billion in let's say market sell off as of today, today's trading session on Thursday, it's close to a trillion dollars of market value has been obliterated in the last week basically and a lot of it, a lot of the conversation is because of the fast advancing artificial intelligence tools that are coming to take on this sector. ServiceNow, Salesforce, Microsoft, Amazon, you name it big. Actually I think Google just announced their earnings just a few hours ago and I think they may have lost some market cap as well. I think it's fears that Amazon and Microsoft and Google are increasing their capex for AI like about 2, 3, 4, 5 fold and investors are just leery about that. So why is this AI related is because as I mentioned earlier, Claude Anthropic, makers of Claude AI they released a few weeks ago Claude Cowork and I think it's taken a couple of weeks for people to realize, holy moly. If Claude Cowork actually can be easily implemented in a company and it's as easy as Claude makes it out to be, and by the way, it's not easy, but it is pretty powerful, then maybe software as a service companies, maybe they are going to be a relic. Meaning why are you paying $20,000 a year for software as a service to a Salesforce or to a HubSpot when Claude Cowork could basically do most of this work for you for maybe $200 a month? I mean, that's the fear. Stock market sells off and while there are definitely some folks who are thinking this is too much of a panic sell off, I think what really hit home today, and this is my main news story of the day, it kind of dovetails right in is both Anthropic released a major upgrade and released their new update to their flagship opus. And at the same day OpenAI released an upgrade and an update to their flagship. And that's why I was saying, mark, this dates down February 5, 2026, Claude Opus 4.6 and open AI. Release there is it 5.3? I thought it was higher, but no 5.3. So let's get into this. The biggest models on the exact same day. It doesn't normally happen now. It happened like about a year and a half ago. Do you remember that when you're in the AI bubble. Can I say bubble? The AI leapfrogging bubble. Every time a Claude would come out, something OpenAI would come come out with their release and then Claude would come out with theirs and then Gemini would come out with theirs and then Deep Seat came out of the blue and then Grok came out with their name Next model. It was leapfrogging and it was difficult to even keep a track of everything. So many models then reasoning dropped in. So many models on that. It's been quiet for let's say last six months about this AI heated rivalry until today. Today, February 5, 2026, two of the biggest players in foundational AI decided to drop their biggest models on the exact same day. And as I mentioned yesterday, I'll go a bit deeper today. Anthropic didn't just release software, they ran a Super bowl ad. That's basically taking a shot directly at OpenAI. Yeah, this is more than just tech news or AI news. This is a fight for market dominance and it matters to every small business owner, entrepreneur and startup right here in the Coachella Valley. And I'll tell you why in a second. So what actually happened. OpenAI released GPT 5.3 Codex, the speed demon on benchmarks, it's 25% faster and crushes coding benchmarks at 77.3%. And here's the wild part. They claim that this AI helped build itself. The team used early versions to debug its own training data and to fix deployment issues, basically claiming to be the first truly self improving AI. If it's true, we knew this day was coming. Just didn't realize I'm going to be here so soon. On the other side of the fence, Anthropic released Claude Opus 4.6, what they call the enterprise specialist. It scored 65.4% on coding and 60.7% on finance and legal tasks. It has agent teams that let multiple AI systems work in parallel on different parts of your project, all coordinating together. So the bottom line from these two foundational models is that OpenAI may have built a faster, better coder. Anthropic may have built a better employee. I use that term because even myself for the last since I've been pulling this radio station together, me as a human, working with and experimenting with in public, an army of agents across all the foundational models. Oh my goodness. This week working with one of the coding models. I won't say which one. I'm telling you I was getting a little frustrated, almost like. And I found myself thinking this way yesterday when I got spent a lot of time doing my version of coding. Remember, I'm not technical coder Rant. I'm a jack of all trades, enough to understand what's going on and I'm able to connect the dots and pull strategy, strategy together. Right? That's my value and that's my claim to fame. So when I'm playing around with these technical tools, trying, you know, playing software developer in the studio, some things are magical. Some things like, wow, can't believe I did that. For the last two days I've been deep into GitHub and deployments and commits of real code because my coding assistant said we can do this. And I'm here to tell you I was getting frustrated with this coding assistant. Almost like I wouldn't say a new employee, but let's just say somebody hired this employee without coming to my department to say, do you have a say in this? Because it is frustrating to no end having to go back and forth telling the coding assistant what we stand for, what the North Star is and what we're trying to accomplish. Oh, and by the way, I shared all this with you earlier this week. So memory and project context is, I know it's there. I read all the time with my, with my fellow AI entrepreneurs that they're doing it, or at least they're claiming to do it. I just haven't unlocked or unpacked that secret. So I'm using this. I think that they're claiming the Anthropic's built a better employee. Here's why I'm saying that too. But before I do that, let's quickly go into a little bit of this super bowl ads. Anthropic actually came out with four super bowl ads and it basically shows. And by the way, if you haven't seen them, you really need to go to YouTube if you can and look at them all and tell me what you think. I mean, you know, there's, there's some, there's some humor in there for sure. But what is the deeper meaning behind this? Right, the four spots show people in real world situations and the AIs are represented by other humans. For example, there's somebody who's trying to get into shape and the AI is represented by a fitness trainer. The funny thing about this is that the human fitness trainer actually sounds like how AI responds. So there's a little humor there. Right? And so as these real people are trying to use AI, they keep getting interrupted by annoying spoken ads. A guy asking for a work advice and the AI tries to sell him height. Height increasing insoles. I think it's called height maxing. Okay, there's another one where someone on a date gets interrupted by dating app ads. And so basically the message from anthropic is, look, ChatGPT is becoming cluttered and consumer focused. Claude on the other hand, is clean, professional and ad free. And while it's funny and some I've heard some kind of criticism about this ad or these set of ads in the tech world. From a strategic point of view, this, where I come from, it's pretty smart strategy. I mean, OpenAI has been going after mass adoption just because they are the household name. They have 7 to 800 million weekly active users doing basically about 2 billion prompts on a daily basis. I mean, that's just nuts to think about, right? They're the Google of AI. Meanwhile, Anthropic is positioning as the premium alternative, the one you pay for because it doesn't waste your time. Two different strategies. OpenAI is betting on consumer ubiquity. They want to be everywhere from students to Fortune 500s. They're building the operating system for AI with the new Codex desktop app they dominate with 81 consumer market share and 56% of enterprise AI spending. Anthropic kind of being the underdog, right, is kind of punching up, is kind of fighting up because it doesn't, you know, it needs to, it needs to claw some of that market share. If they're also going to be a multi trillion dollar foundational AI public company and they're betting on enterprises and enterprise trust. They're integrating into PowerPoint, Excel, Slack. They say we're not replacing your tools, they're just making them smarter. The Wall street thinks otherwise. That's why the big sell off and it's, and it's kind of working because their enterprise Penetration has jumped 25 in the last nine months and they are integrated in about 44% of large companies. This was, these are numbers that were given, provided by the decoder, an online source. So what does this mean? I mentioned to you I'm going to bring it down to what it means to us in the Coachella Valley. Similar to what I said yesterday is if you're running a small business in, in the Valley, you may not be thinking about the AI benchmarks and, or should you? You don't want to know how the engine's made, right? But you are thinking, wow, this, these AI models should save me time. How do I save time and how can I compete with bigger companies and can I do this within my budget? Now, if you were in any of our workshops that we did last year, we gave you training and we gave you tools and we showed you how to implement some of this stuff into your business. And for many of you that attended, it was like one of the first few times you'd actually even built with coding assistance and working with code and deploying it via GitHub or Vercel. And while yeah, it might have been scary the first time because we were holding your hands all the way through, I have many, many emails and DMS and coffee meets since then that they're just now thankful that they were slowly introduced into the development world as a world coding world, what we call vibe coding, right? Because now they're just experimenting like crazy. And the good news if you're a small business owner, is these tools are powerful enough to be like a virtual employee. And because the cost is dropping, your ability to access these amazing capabilities. I'm not sure if we're going to ever get it back this inexpensively. Maybe it's still another 12 to 18 months ago, but do you remember the days of Uber if you were around when Uber first came along. Uber rides were just, they were just subsidized by the big VCs. You know, Uber raised, you know, hundreds of millions of dollars to create market share and basically just land and expand and back. Back in those days, while the magic of Uber was magical, what was also fantastic was it was cheap. And by the way, the drivers got like 85% of that fare. That's why you had so many people wanting to be drivers because they were making good money and we had so many riders because it was cheap. Well, Fast forward what, 10 years? I think it's over 10 years now. It's like 14 years. Well, Uber is still magical in terms of their brilliant app and their understanding of getting you from A to B. But let's be, let's be real, it's not cheap anymore, right? Even just taking a trip from where I am in Rancho Mirage to Palm Springs for an event in the evening, sometimes $30, and it's like, okay, maybe some of you, that's chump change, doesn't mean anything to me. It's like, well that's like, that's like a tank of petrol, right? Anyway, I'm digressing. I think now's the time for you as a small business owner to be experimenting with AI. That's, that's a broken record. I've been saying that for what, three years now? If you haven't, by the way, if you've delved, if you've jumped in, congratulations. If you're hitting a wall, reach out Sunshine fm. Just send me an email and happy to listen to what you're struggling with and what you're trying to accomplish and where. Me and my team, we're happy to help you realistically get to the next level and how to build foundationals for growth with AI tools and services. As I mentioned yesterday, there is a, there is a double edged sword to this, right? If you're like a service business, like a real estate agent or an accountant or consultant or a marketing agency, Claude, Opus 4.6 is not, I shouldn't say definitely, that's, you know, it's kind of biased, but it can be. Your play creates great client presentations, it analyzes financial data better than most, and it manages complex projects without interrupting you with ads. That's their play, right? The PowerPoint integration is pretty powerful. But having said that, if you came to our workshops, you'll know that we also shared with you genspark and Manus and even nanobanana Pro, which can do these presentations pretty, pretty brilliantly as well, so it's not just Claude. Claude just happens to be the foundation that a lot of these other services are built upon. So Claude may be more expensive to run, but just know this, you're paying for professionalism and kind of focus, right? If you want speed and affordability, yes. Google Gemini is there too. And happy to talk to you about that one of these days. But right now we're just focusing on the two that updated, right. 5.3 codecs by OpenAI is basically the model that's going to help you get from zero to one much, much faster. The desktop app lets you coordinate multiple coding agents, which means a solo founder can also do the work of a small dev team. That's kind of what I'm doing. Solo founder with a small but mighty army of AI agents. And what I'm, what I talk about yesterday about the pros and cons about this is this. If this is accessible to you as a small business, great experiment, play around with it. If on the other hand, you are a service business, who is providing this sort of service, whether it's legal or financial or design or writing or social media or marketing or videos, if that same tool and power that's helping you maybe take on more clients or do your work quicker is now available to the small businesses who right now pay you, is there a possibility that there'll be less need for service businesses and consultants? Or will the small businesses and enterprises just carry on doing what they're doing, business as usual, leaving it to you to be better at what you do? The jury is out. I don't know. I have a sense of where this might go, but that doesn't necessarily mean that is exactly what we're going to, how we're going to go. Right? I think we have a 12 to 18 month window where you need to build your foundation and start experimenting with AI and build your AI council within your company and start taking this more seriously than you might have been right now. Right now might make you might write your emails, it might write your social media and if you're on LinkedIn or Instagram or Facebook anytime lately, you know most of this is AI generated, right? And I think if we're serious about the Coachella Valley economy, the more people that we can help up level and get AI fluent and AI trained, I think the better for everybody. Which leads me to which by the way, aicv, that's what we do at aicv. Which leads me to. The other headline that came out this yet today US job cuts hit 17 year high as hiring plans plunge. According to Challenger Gray and Christmas, which is an outplacement firm, they basically say that this January is the worst start to a year since 2009. And the figure represents a 205% jump from December and 118% increase compared to January of last year. And while we all, well just say we all, we, we maybe we felt that 2026 was going to be maybe soft economically because obviously if, I mean have you not felt the prices, they have not come down at all over the last couple of years. My, my, my grocery bill at Trader Joe's. Oh my goodness, it's, it, it's like a kid never left home. You know, it's still, it's gotten more expensive. You know this and I know this. We're feeling it everywhere we go. But going out to eat, pretty pricey. Just, just everything's pretty pricey. And so we, we kind of knew that 2026 was going to be a bit of a softer economy. But the reason why I'm bringing it up is because it's exactly what we, we've been talking about at AICV for the last year and a half to most of all the, let's say academics, educational institutions in town about how are you integrating AI into your curriculums so that we can better prepare our workforce for the work of the future? While we didn't say work jobs were going away, what we did say a year and a half ago and all last year was businesses, companies are just not going to hire as much, mostly flatline, because why would you hire an entry level worker if you have an AI that can do entry level work? You may not be cutting jobs like Amazon cut 30,000 jobs and Microsoft cost 50 something thousand jobs over the last year, but you may not be hiring as quickly. Now this report, 17, was it 17 year high, 108,000 jobs cut in January. I mean it doesn't help matters, right? And where are they going to go? They're going to number one, flood the job market looking for jobs. But as we've been training all last year is how do we arm you with AI training and fluency and the tools and the know how so that you can go ahead and provide that expertise or at least early understanding of AI to businesses that are going to need it. Because we believe unless you're AI fluent, you're not going to be hirable. I do not think that's changed at all. As a matter of fact, I do think that AI is responsible for the majority of job losses. And I think that's just going to actually accelerate this year. And that's why I was so adamant about training the next generation workforce and anybody was interested about getting yourself AI fluent and AI literate because the disruption to the marketplace, the economy is going to be deeper than people believe and faster and arrive much faster than most people think. Now, fingers crossed. I'm totally wrong. I've been known to be wrong, but I've been, I've been shouting this from the rooftops for the last couple of years. So this doesn't really surprise me. I mentioned this last week when Anthropic CEO Dario Ahmadi warned in his, in his follow up to Machines of Loving Grace Paper, when he warned that AI could deliver an unusually painful shock to the job market, one that would surpass previous technological disruptions. He had also cautioned that AI could eliminate half of all entry level white collar positions within five years, potentially driving to a much higher unemployment rate. Now he was pooh poohed for that. People talking that he's talking his own book because he's developed. He's obviously the CEO of one of the biggest foundational companies that's going to benefit from this. It's causing this and it's going to benefit from it. Maybe, but you know, it's right in line with what I've been, you know, I wouldn't say warning of, but in my own way been trying to get people to drink the Kool Aid as I have done. So how do we, how do we segue from that to this other story? Now this won't make your RAID albums probably it'll make for fun coffee talk or whatever. But I wanted to connect the dots here, right? Wild, wild, not turn of events, but what this one startup is doing. Okay, so here's, here's, here's what's going on. Okay? There's a crypto engineer named Alexander Light, plo, He just launched a platform called and now wait for it and you can visit if you can visit the website if you want. It's called Rent a Human AI. Do I need to go any further? You know where I'm going with this, right? It's basically a reverse mechanical turk. Okay, so here's the problem, right? Autonomous AI agents that we spoke about for the last few weeks, right? They're getting smarter, but they still have a major limitation and that is this. They still just live on servers, they just live in your computers. They can't touch grass, they can't pick up a coffee, they can't check a mailbox and they can't physically verify anything. The solution, according to Alexander, is create a marketplace that, where AI bots can post bounties for physical tasks. In other words, you as a human. I'm presuming you're human. Listening to me. You create a profile, you pick up the task, you do the physical labor, and then the AI agent AI bot pays you instantly in cryptocurrency. And here's the kill, here's a kicker. In just the first few days, over 80,000 humans signed up to be hired by roughly 80 AI agents. The demand for what he calls human hardware is immediate. Oh my goodness, what a disturbing concept this is. And what a disturbing name, right? Human hardware. Bottom line, you know, this is not this. I mean, oh my goodness. I don't know where to go with this, except I wanted to bring it to your attention and just let you know the desperation that could be out there. You know, are we actually heading. Well, first of all, I know we're heading toward a future of humanoid robots like Tesla Optimus, right? You heard that the CEO of Tesla is going to discontinue making its Model S and Model X out of this Fremont, out of their Fremont plant and turn that all into building humanoid robots, right? The Tesla Optimus. And then figure that's another big company out there. And those humanoids, robotics are where the AI is the brain and the robot is the body, but we aren't quite there yet. The brain is getting there. That's artificial intelligence. The robot body, the humanoid, is just not quite there yet. So what happens when the robots aren't ready is, well, until the robots arrive, the humans are the stopgap. Right now, according to the developer, humans are the arms and the legs and the hands for those digital brains. The AI is outsourcing the physicality to humans because it's cheaper and faster than waiting for a droid to be built. And basically it treats human labor effectively like a software API call, just another resource to execute a command. Oh my goodness. I know I shouldn't be laughing about this, because it is not. I mean, I don't want that to occur, especially not like a long term sustainable scalable model. But let me ask you this. Is it any different than you ordering on Uber Eats or ordering on instacart or on DoorDash? We just, or even Uber, really? You just press a button on your smartphone and the food is delivered to you by folks that are what we call in the gig economy. When was the last time you heard that term gig economy? And while early days they were paid well. Now it's, you know, if you talk to most of the drivers and most of the delivery people like I do, on consistent continuously because I do want to learn. They don't seem too happy in their work. They're thankful for the flexibility, but no, it's a grind for them as well. The only difference with this Rent a Human is first of all, bad naming, bad branding if you ask me. But on one hand the humans are gig employees. On the other hand, it's a directive coming from a mobile phone. It just won't be done by a human. It's done by the agent who's trying to complete a task for a human. Yeah, wild, right? All right, fine. Enough of that. I was going to go into what Apple's doing lately and for you,OS and iPhone owners who always make fun of me as a Google Android carrier, yes, we know Apple has been dropping the ball in AI, but there is some good news and I do have some updates about that, so stay tuned. It won't be tomorrow, mostly be next week. I'll do a little bit of a deeper dive into some of the cool stuff that Apple's coming out with. And you should be kind of thrilled that Apple will come, I want to say roaring back, but they will come back in 2026 with a couple of updates and some new devices. Here's something I thought was kind of interesting. It's nothing major, but if you remember, last year, was it? Yeah, I think a year ago chat GPT's image maker went viral when they came out with the Ghibli Studio version of turning your own, let's say photograph into a Ghibli style. I know I used a couple of those because I thought I like the art. It was kind of cool. Well, just the last few days, Open AI, makers of Chat GPT. Chat GPT, they have this viral trend for the last couple of days globally, by the way, called Chat GPT Caricature trend, where users on TikTok, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc, etc are using Twitter ChatGPT. And the challenge is not so much here's a photograph, turn this into something cute, cartoony, etc. But the prompt ends up being based on everything you know about me to date, whether you've been using it for a couple of months or a couple of years, based on everything you know about me, check Chat GPT create a caricature based on that and then the AI generates a satirical exaggerated cartoon portrait using details from the user's photo that you do upload and in addition to the long term conversation history. Now that's all fun, it's all novel. I know that when people were asking me last year, how safe is your data? I'll say it's pretty safe within their ecosystems. But just remember, even if you check, don't use my data for training purposes. That doesn't mean they can't use your data for ad targeting purposes and fun things like this. Okay, so if you want to go to hashtag chat GPT caricature or hashtag air, you'll start seeing a lot of these cartoon characters pop up. And you can do it for yourself too, right? I mean, at the end of the day, people love seeing how an impartial AI perceives them, especially when the results are brutally accurate and they might share them with their friends. They may not. Depends on how accurate they are. Now, there were quite a lot of developers at this believing that the sheer volume of that complex image generation request, which does take a lot of compute power, and the sheer virality of this hashtag caused a lot of the slowdown and possible downing of servers that chat GPT was on. So if you felt over the last 48 hours, 72 hours, your chat GPT was slower, it could have been because of that silly hashtag. Okay, Whatever you do, if you do decide to do this, you don't have to share it with me. I don't need to know. I'll be looking myself. And finally, some real positive news about what AI promises us as humans, especially here for Coachella Valley, when we do have a large demographic of, let's say, aging adults and seniors. There's a team of researchers from Mass General Brigham, which is a big hospital in Boston, and it's also associated with Harvard. They created a new foundational model called brainiac. And the way I want you to think about this is it's like chatgpt, but for brain scans. And this model, instead of learning words, it Learned from nearly 49,000 MRI scans to spot patterns that humans normally miss. It's currently coming out of Boston. The paper and the research was published in Nature's Neuroscience. And because it's software, not a physical machine, it could theoretically be deployed to imaging centers everywhere once it gets through regulatory hurdles. So Eisenhower Desert Regional, we could have these capabilities local. It was officially announced today, February 5, 2026. And it's there to solve a huge problem in medicine, which is the specialist bottleneck. Usually you need a hyper specialized neuroradiologist to spot rare tumor mutations or subtle dementia. Signs. This tool will help regular doctors see those things instantly, even with less than perfect data. So hopefully insurance will cover it. But more hopeful is the idea that we don't have to wait days or weeks to get results because we're waiting for some specialist to read them and get back to us. Right? This should mean lower costs. But you know, I'll leave it to you. If you're in the healthcare industry, you know better than most of us. And if you're just a consumer, if you're just a patient, we have our own interpretations of what happens with these capabilities. It'll be lower costs for the healthcare providers. Will it come down to us as the patients? I don't know, but it should help. Because if the AI can spot a tumor mutation from a standard mri, not a specialized, but a standard, it could mean skipping invasive biopsy or expensive genetic testing. Also, that's the reason why I wanted to bring it up to everybody here in Palm Springs. Coachella. The Coachella Valley is catching dementia earlier. Saves massive amounts on long term care management. This we know firsthand, right? This is an efficiency play for hospitals. Instead of needing 10,000 labeled images to train a system to find one cancer type, this model can learn from unlabeled data, which is the power and promise of unstructured data that AI can handle much better than humans. Riverside county already lists Alzheimer's dementia as the third leading cause of death for residents over 65. Brainiac is specifically designed to predict brain age and dementia risk before obvious systems start, which we know plenty of people in our lives and our families, especially friends and neighbors in this valley, feels like they, they wish they had detected it earlier. So bottom line, we have access to expertise. The whole premise of AI is you have access to the world's experts in almost every domain in the palm of your hands. Brain IAC is a really, really good use of that. It brings this unparalleled access to this expertise to our local hospitals. Not just Cedars Sinai, Cedars Sinai or ucla, but right here in our local valley. Pretty powerful, right? I'm not sure if you noticed, but there was no. Hardly any interstitials today. I did hardly do any. Did I change that one right now? Oh yeah. You're listening to Sunshine fm. What are we? Yes, we are. Nice one. Very good. There was an interstitial station ID all rolled into one. Wow, that was pretty dense today, right? Hopefully that last article about Brain IAC will at least give you some hope and promise about what AI is going to do. I'm going to leave you with another AI2 song. As you know, Sunshine FM is modern media for Palm Springs, Coachella. Everything you hear, except for my voice, is AI generated. If you're playing around with AI generated music, you're a producer, like I am the recording engineer and you're using AI to help co write some of these what I call demo ready music that you won't hear anywhere else. Go to Sunshine fm. Send me an email. Let's get you on the show. Have yourselves a fantastic day. We'll see you again tomorrow.
