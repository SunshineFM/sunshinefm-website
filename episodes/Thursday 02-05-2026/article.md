Hey,

This is Sat. Just poured my second glass of Pinot, and honestly? I'm still buzzing from today's show - not from the wine, but from what actually went down in AI land today.

## February 5th: The Day the Gloves Came Off

You know what really got me thinking after I wrapped? This wasn't just another tech announcement day. OpenAI and Anthropic dropping their biggest updates on the exact same day? That's a declaration of war, wrapped in press releases and Super Bowl ads.

I keep coming back to something - we haven't seen this level of coordinated aggression since the early leapfrogging days. For months, it's been relatively quiet. Everyone's been heads-down, building. Then boom - GPT 5.3 Codex and Claude Opus 4.6 land on the same Tuesday like some kind of AI D-Day.

The part that's honestly keeping me up tonight? OpenAI's claim that their AI helped build itself. Look, we all knew self-improving AI was coming. But hearing them say it so casually, like it's just another feature update? That hit different. We're not talking about the future anymore - we're living in it.

## The Real Story Behind That Stock Sell-Off

Here's what I didn't say on-air: I think Wall Street finally gets it. Not the promise - they've been drunk on that for two years. They finally understand the threat.

A trillion dollars wiped out in a week because investors are realizing that maybe, just maybe, paying Salesforce twenty grand a year doesn't make sense when Claude can do 80% of that work for $200 a month. And honestly? They're not wrong to be scared.

I've been playing around with these tools all week - getting frustrated like I'm managing a new employee who doesn't quite get our vibe yet. But when it works? When it really works? I can see why ServiceNow's stock is in free fall.

## Anthropic's Super Bowl Play Was Genius

Those ads everyone's debating? Pure strategy gold. While OpenAI's chasing every consumer on the planet with their 800 million users, Anthropic's saying "we're the premium option for people who actually have work to do."

The fitness trainer ad where the AI sounds exactly like... well, like AI? Brilliant. They're making fun of themselves while simultaneously positioning as the serious business choice. Meanwhile, Claude's quietly integrating into PowerPoint and Excel, not trying to replace your workflow but making it smarter.

Two completely different bets on the future, and honestly, I think there's room for both to win.

## What This Actually Means for Us Out Here

The part that stuck with me most from today's show was talking about the cultural bottleneck. Because after two years of consulting with local businesses, I can tell you the technology isn't the problem anymore. It's getting everyone in the same room to actually talk about it.

You've got the enthusiasts who want to automate everything yesterday. You've got the skeptics who think AI is coming for their jobs. And you've got leadership caught in the middle, trying to figure out which vendor to bet on while the ground shifts under their feet every few months.

That safe space I kept talking about? It's not just feel-good consultant speak. It's the difference between companies that'll thrive in this mess and companies that'll get left behind arguing about whether to adopt AI while their competitors are already using it to eat their lunch.

## The Thing Nobody Wants to Say

Here's my most honest take, three glasses in: we're all winging it. Every consultant, every AI company, every business owner trying to implement this stuff. There's no playbook because we're writing it in real time.

The difference is some people are comfortable admitting they don't know everything and are willing to experiment. Others are paralyzed by the fear of making the wrong choice. But here's the thing - not choosing is also a choice. And it's probably the worst one you can make right now.

Those 20 workshops we did last year? Half the attendees are already ahead of their competition. The other half are still waiting for someone to tell them exactly what to do. Guess which group is winning.

Talk soon,
Sat
