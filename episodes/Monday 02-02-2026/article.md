Hey,

This is Sat, and holy shit what a weird three weeks this has been building radio in public while slightly drunk on possibility.

## The Grammys Said Nothing About AI (And That Says Everything)

You know what really got me thinking after last night? I'm sitting here with my second glass of wine, and I keep coming back to the deafening silence at the Grammys about AI. Not. One. Mention. 

Meanwhile, I've got Rani - our AI artist - dropping tracks about checking into Palm Springs hotels that are more relatable than half the stuff that won awards last night. The kicker? When I played her music for people this week, they couldn't tell the difference. My son can, bless his audiophile heart, but most people? Nope.

And here's the thing that's keeping me up - 47% of high schoolers surveyed don't care if music is AI-generated or not. The industry had their biggest night and pretended this revolution isn't happening. That's either brilliant strategy or complete denial. I'm betting on denial.

## Building AI Agents is Like Herding Drunk Cats

Three weeks into this experiment, and I've failed publicly more times than I care to count. Put something up Monday, it's broken by Tuesday. That's just where we are with AI tech right now - I have enough technical knowledge to be dangerous but not enough to keep these agents from going completely rogue.

Claude Cowork has been making up folders on my computer like it's playing SimCity. I give it permission to help organize my files, and it creates seventeen new directories I didn't ask for. It's chaos, but it's *productive* chaos, which somehow feels very 2026.

The thing is, unlike SEO which takes months to maybe get you on page one of Google, we've got this window where small businesses here in the valley can actually get cited by ChatGPT and Claude right now. Today. Before the big players figure it out. That's why we built that little tool - check if your website is visible to AI, get the code to fix it, done.

## LinkedIn Has Become AI Talking to AI

Speaking of things that make me reach for wine - have you been on LinkedIn lately? It's like watching robots having conversations with other robots while pretending to be humans. The posts, the comments, probably half the profiles. It's a preview of what's coming everywhere else.

## The Copyright Conversation Nobody Wants to Have

Here's my slightly wine-fueled prediction: copyright and IP as we know it are slowly becoming irrelevant. Not next year, but in the next five to ten? The whole system is starting to feel like trying to build sandcastles while the tide's coming in.

If you're a copyright attorney in the valley and think I'm completely wrong, let's get you on the show. This affects every creative person out here, and we need to have this conversation in the open.

## What Actually Matters Right Now

Look, I can't tell current artists apart half the time anyway - that's my classic rock bias showing. But when our AI artists are creating music about specific places and experiences that actually connect with people, while the "real" music industry ignores the technology entirely? 

Something's shifting. Fast.

The young generation doesn't care about the purity test. They just want good music. Meanwhile, my demo is pushing it away like it's radioactive. And I'm here in the middle, co-creating with machines and having more fun than I've had making content in years.

We're building in public, failing in public, learning in public. It's messy and imperfect and exactly where we need to be right now.

Talk soon,
Sat
