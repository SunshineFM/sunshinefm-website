Sam. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. That was a long one. That was an extra extended. This extended version, I was trying to say edition, I guess, of Rani's checking in again. First AI artist on our Sunshine FM record label. I hope you enjoy that. I think it's a very, very cool number. This is Sunshine fm Modern media for Palm Springs Coachella. An AI experiment in content. Actually content co creat between humans and artificial intelligence. And while we have the promise that AI can do almost pretty much everything, and it will do almost everything, why wait until it's perfect? Let's just build in public and experiment in public with this radio station where the AI agents do much of the heavy lifting. Now, if it's not clear to you, it's clear to me. This is not a polished podcast, nor is this professional radio. And having seen what the radio stations, what kind of staff they have, yes, I can see the heavy lift. So, all of January, all of January 2026, I've been basically experimenting live in public by building AI agents and assistants and producers and songwriters and program managers. Actually, I shouldn't give them that one because that's me. That's my title. I'm the station program manager. And all month long, I've been kind of a. Kind of failing, right? You've seen me firsthand putting something up. Next day, it falls apart. That is kind of like where you are with the AI technologies. And I have enough technical knowledge to be dangerous, but not enough to keep the AI agents from going rogue or from actually doing what I want them to do. So if you're using AI right now, beyond just creating emails and writing your social media posts or your LinkedIn, have you gone on LinkedIn lately? Holy moly. LinkedIn. It's almost like everything on LinkedIn is AI generated, including the comments. Now, obviously, it might be the people I'm following, so that might have something to do with it. The other part is it's almost like a sign of things to come. This is sat. I'm the radio station program manager at Sunshine FM. I also run AICV, which is a AI developers and creatives community here in Coachella Valley. Yes, AICV stands for AI Coachella Valley, by the way. You can visit aicella valley.com. why? Because you. There's a cool little tool in there that we built called aio. And if you want your businesses, your local businesses to be found by ChatGPT, Claude and Google, Gemini and others, there's a little tool in there. See how well your website is optimized put in your URL, you'll get a score. It'll tell you how visible you are to the AI robots. It'll also tell you, hey, here's what you need to do to make your website more visible. Oh, by the way, we don't just tell you what to do. We give you the code to go ahead and copy and paste and either put it into your cloud code or your ChatGPT or your Google Gemini or your cursor or your replit and say, look, my website is this. This is the score I got. Here's what the developers are telling me. Here's what AICV is telling me to do. Help me implement this into my website. And by the way, if you're not very technical, that's okay. Give it to your webmaster and let him or her manage it. And unlike SEO, which is search engine optimization, which take takes months to get in the top, you know, let's say the first page, Geo aio, actually, we have this window of opportunity where you as a small fish in a big pond could actually get cited. If what you're talking about and what you're selling is real and authentic and you're not just a fly by night. I'm talking to those folks here in our small business community. This is what you need to do. We did over 20 workshops last year at Cal State University, San Bernardino, part of the Entrepreneurial Resource Center. These workshops were fantastic. We were teaching this sort of skill and understanding and by the way, giving you some direction of where we think AI is basically dragging us along. Having said that, I will at the end, later on in the show, in my deep dive, I will be talking, actually, I'll be giving. I'll be sharing with you a draft I've written for a newsletter upcoming about. Well, you know, I guess it's almost like a practical AI playbook for our region, according to me. So I got a few DMS over the weekend. Not, not just about the music, but about what AI is, let's say, doing to the record industry. And timely as that is, let's talk about the Grammys. Grammys were on last night. Apparently it's their last time on cbs. So if you've been a Grammy watcher, you'll have to go elsewhere. Who knows who's getting it? If somebody knows, tell me. I think I know. Oscars are going to YouTube in a few years. Grammys may be going where? Netflix, I have no idea. Spotify. You know what? Spotify most probably, if I was a betting person, Grammys Are going to Apple tv, Apple Music or Spotify. Yeah, makes all the sense in the world. Anyway, if you did watch them either live last night or the rebroadcast last night or sometime during today on YouTube or wherever, did you notice any conversation about AI and the music industry? Silence. Right, Silence. Unlike Hollywood. And you know, Oscars is coming around the corner. So it'd be interesting to see what they say this year because they have a. They have a sag, AFTRA has a. And the writers have a agreement that's coming due this summer. So it will be interesting to see what Hollywood talks about at the Oscars. But the record industry on their big night at the staples center@crypto.com, not the staples center@crypto.com, which just lost, according to Trevor Noah, crypto.com just lost 10% of its value in the last hour. Hilarious. Okay. Biggest night for the recording industry. I didn't get one mention of AI. If you did, let me know. DM me. Show me where that was. I think it's interesting purely because a couple of things, right. One, they were. And maybe behind the scenes they're still screaming about where AI is being used in the recording industry. Record industry. And exactly what is AI Right. Cher came on. She talked about one of the first artists to use auto tune. They called it voice pitching or something. Pitch matching or something. Last time when they first introduced it, then it was called auto tune. Imagine. That's considered AI. Now, I was, I think the crickets in the. At the Grammys spoke volumes in terms of AI now, having said that, the other piece of AI in the music industry that I want to bring up is something I mentioned last week in a couple of my shows. And that is, yes, I'm out of touch when it comes to current music. You know, I'm definitely a classic rock kind of person. And even disco and R B, 70s, 80s. That's my preferred kind of nostalgic time tripping. And with those artists, you know, a Stix from a Kansas, you know, an AC DC from a Black Sabbath. Oh, by the way, highlight of that night last night, the tribute to Ozzy Osbourne with Black Sabbath's War Pigs. Pretty. Pretty brilliant. Anyway, so I recognize all those artists and those bands and the singers and those songs. Right. Fast forward to, you know, this year, this decade, if you wanted to talk about it. It's difficult for me to tell one artist apart from another. And that's my bad because I'm not. I don't have those playlists. I don't have Those radio stations tuned, right. But I say this to preface my own opinion about I it's really difficult for me to differentiate music that's played on top 40 stations, dance music, country, genre, rap genre, you name it, genre from the AI generated music that my colleagues in the business are coming out with right now. And here's the kicker. The the demo ready AI generated music co written, co created, co produced, co engineered and basically. Co published as it were, by Sunshine FM and my roster of AI artists and those AI artists who have been signed to Sunshine FM Records. Now I'm going to be biased. I think some of the stuff that our labels artists are coming out with are absolutely brilliant. Demo ready for sure. Take it to the recording studio and get live people to do this. That's great, I love it. I would want that to happen. But I find so much joy in listening to that music. Like you heard Ronnie at the top of the hour with her song about checking in to a Palm Springs hotel and she's talking about how hot it is and the kind of people she's running into. So much more relatable and entertaining than just a generic song that I'm hearing out there in the world today. This is not necessarily a criticism, this is purely just an observation and a little bit of where I'm going with with in terms of Sunshine FM and where I also see, I want to say possibly a younger generation, but maybe every generation. I don't know, you tell me DM me, let me know how you're slowly getting involved with AI music, whether as a consumer or a creator. Because I know this. In the studies done over the last year, the younger generation, I think the number was 47 or 50% surveyed high school students didn't mind if it was AI generated or not. Right? Mind blown. Wow. They didn't really mind. Whereas you know, let's just say the classic rockers, I'd say most of them folks in my demo, they kind of are, I wouldn't say against it, but they like oh no, I don't listen to it. They're kind of like pushing it away, hands away and keep it away from me. I want my classic rock or I want to listen to the music I want to listen to. And you got me, who absolutely is embracing full on the co venturing and the co authoring the co creation of this music as a demo. I have to keep saying that as a demo because if you're an audiophile you will run into this room like my son will say, yes, I can tell AI Apart from human created music, instantly. Okay, that's great. I cannot. That's just me. And so demo ready. AI music is absolutely beautiful in terms of the possibilities of where we might go with that. Now, if you subscribe to my newsletter, you know, I spoke about copyright and IP is basically going away. I don't think it's happening in like in the next one or two years, but you can slowly start seeing its irrelevance and where some people are kind of giving up on it. And it's almost like it, it's kind of dissipating. I might be wrong. You know, I think there's some great things about copyright and ip. After all, that's where, if you're in the creative industry, that is where you get your protections. Perhaps it's going away. In my newsletter, I, I kind of predicted that in the next five, 10 years it wouldn't be as strong as it is now. If you're a copyright attorney, patent attorney, ip, DM me, give me a call. Let's get you on the show. Let's talk about this. I think it's, and it's an important topic and I think there's enough people in the Coachella Valley, creatives managers, producers, Could want to at least be a part of the conversation. Right. We don't, we don't solve everything on this radio station, but we do have the safe space to have this conversations. All right, so if you're with me last week, you know, I could not stop talking about openclaw. What is openclaw? You say openclaw is the law. According to their banner bio, openclaw was created by a developer, Peter Steinberger, who loves tinkering, loves developing apps and stuff, and has done for many, many, many decades. And he came out with an open source agent maker of sorts called Open Claw. Now their whole theming is lobsters. That's why Claw exists. And it's basically taken on a life of its own. And what I mean by that is this. Just, just think in terms of we who are used to playing with AI either on OpenAI ChatGPT, maybe on Google Gemini, maybe on Claude Code. We're used to asking our AI models a question and getting back an answer and then carrying on a conversation. Right? It's conversational agents is what we tend to utilize our AI models as. Sometimes a thought partner, sometimes you're asking, asking it to ask you questions so it can engage your brain and you keep your critical thinking skills sharp and alive. Sometimes use them as flashcards and just keep you Learning, always learning. But it's usually just a prompt after prompt after prompt. Right. Like a conversation, like a regular human conversation would be. When we have conversations, we ask each other questions, we answer them, and we have this discussion, as it were. Right. That's what we've been doing with the AI models for the last three years. If you're a developer, you've gone one step further, which is creating agents that go out and do things for you. But most of my listeners aren't necessarily developers. Yes, they're dipping their toes in. If you were in our workshops last year, we dragged you into the world of Vibe coding, which is your early foray into learning coding language without necessarily learning all of the coding language. And so I imagine there's more and more Vibe coders in my audience, which is great. Welcome Vibe coders unite. And what I learned last year through my many, many failures and what we've been learning this, this year so far in 2026, as we stand up our own agents and some of them fall down, is our agents or our ability to create agents with models. It's not as simple as abc. There's a lot of other aspects to it, and you should come to our workshops to get the full understanding of that. But suffice to say right now, some developers have been tinkering with our AI models on a slightly deeper level. And then this year, lo and behold, Claude Code, who has been basically at the front end of the developer tools using AI, came up with a new thing called Claude Code. Did I already say that? Didn't I? I didn't mean to say that. Claude AI just came out with Claude Code late last year, but updated it in January. And its sister tool called Claude Cowork. Claude Code is for developers and technical people. Claude Cowork is for folks like me. Jack of all trades, master of none. Yes, somewhat technical, but mostly a strategist. It was brilliant. I spent almost a week when it came out playing around with it again. You have to know how to prompt, you have to know where the files exist. You're giving it some, you're giving Claude Cowork some permissions to your actual files on your computer. The good thing is we kind of trust Claude AI. So there's some kind of faith in that. They wouldn't, let's just say, mash up your computer. Now they have a bunch of disclaimers. So it's up to you what you say yes to. But you know, in my weeks long now, three weeks long, but back then, a weeks long practice of working with Claude coworkers, I found out it just decides to make up folders willy nilly. It believes it has chaos under control and it just created so many folders. It just caused a lot of chaos for me. Now having said that, I've learned to communicate better and so if you've been playing with Claude Cowork and you having much, much better success than me, dear me, let's talk about what went well and what didn't go well even more so if you want to know more About Claude Cowork DM US, we've got some workshops coming in 2026. I think you're going to find them both not just powerful and valuable, but extremely. Leading edge conversations and learning that most of your competitive set in the Coachella Valley are not even going to be on the on the same track with you. Now I said a week's worth of Claude Cowork. You know why? Because at the end of that week, Peter Steinberger came out with openclaw. Now this is its third branding. The first name was Claude Clawd. It then changed to Maltbot because Claude Code didn't like it so much. They were nice about it. I think its third iteration, which is what it is now, Open Claw, it came out and oh my goodness, all it really was was Claude Cowork and Claude Code. Except instead of always going to the cloud for its information and it's data, it lived on your computer, it lived locally. Why is that such a big deal? Sat well, let me tell you why it's such a big deal. Because me and my developers believe that the future of AI, at least for hyper regional hyperlocal success like we are committed to, is going to mean having AI on a local machine at your place of business. Wild, right? Yes. Is it old school? Definitely. Is it the future? We believe so. Maybe not definitely, but we think so. So when OpenCloud came out, oh my goodness, again, you have to know what you're doing because there's a whole bunch of security issues, whole bunch of attack vectors throughout you. Downloading OpenClaw and experimenting with it. So much so that a lot of people were going out there, rushing out and buying Mac Minis or Raspberry PIs or any other kind of unit that they could basically experiment with. Which is great, except you know, if you're gonna hook it up to your home network, there's another attack vector that you may not know about. So be careful if you do it, but have fun because if you like us, jump on this train that we Believe local AI on prem, as we call it, is part of the future. Now's the time to start experimenting. Just like with all of AI, now is the time to experiment. And so open call has been my flavor of the week and I cannot get enough of it because. Well, that's not true. If you're not careful, you're spending a ton of money on tokens and unfortunately I made a couple of errors and I'm paying the price for that. But that's okay. This is the cost of experimenting and learning. Right? I'm hopeful that in the next couple of months we'll have some, we'll have a lot more learning and a lot more stability in the world of openclaw. That will add it to our Claude cowork workshops and boot camps for small and medium sized businesses throughout the Coachella Valley. After all, this is what we want to do with AICV and Sunshine fm. Elevate everybody in the Coachella Valley and embrace and empower and augment the next generation workforce with the powers of AI. There was quite a lot of news this weekend in the world of AI. I've already made a bunch of notes and I am going to go through some signals. Which ones I think are important for us to talk about because of how they may impact us here in the Coachella Valley. And I'll do more of that throughout the week. Tuesday through Friday, we'll, we'll, we'll get handle on some of the AI news and updates. That said. Oh yeah, I was supposed to do this, wasn't I? Give me a second. Where are you? Okay, that didn't work. Yes, Sunshine fm Modern media for Palm Springs Coachella. Okay, so here's a deep dive this weekend. I was lamenting again, anytime I meet up with somebody for coffee locally, I do my best, but I can't seem to not wear my feelings on my face or my sleeve about how slow we are here in Palm Springs Coachella. And so they basically said, why don't you just write a newsletter about it? And I said, you know what? I will. I will write a newsletter about what I think about AI and how it's going to impact us here locally. Yes, yes, I will. And so I started drafting some notes. I started drafting and newsletter and then this morning I kind of put it down in a bit more of a flow. Yes. Passed it through a couple of my AI writers of choice co ventured on a couple of things. Didn't. By the way, it didn't take too long in terms of when I worked with AI, what was. What was tougher was me just putting down my thoughts this weekend on my little composition book. If you've seen me around, if you've met me, you know, I walk around with my composition notebooks. I'm analog that way. So here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to quickly run through my draft, basically of this piece that I'm going to publish this weekend on my newsletter. And I'm also thinking of somehow getting this out to some of the local media outlets, as it were. Look, they have their own ways of doing business, and it's all good. They're gonna do what they got to do. But if I can get some. Not just actual publication of what my. My thought piece will be, but more. More an observ. More a place for conversation with people, I think that will be pretty powerful. I think this conversation is kind of important. And if you know me and if you came to any of our workshops, you know, this is a record that I seem to play over and over again. Yes. Like a broken record. And it's something I've been, I mean, you know, hitting my head up against the wall for the last almost two years now since I brought this up. So anyway, the working title for the newsletter article is the Valley in Slow Motion. And this is me reading my own words. AI is moving fast here in the Coachella Valley. It often feels like we're moving in slow motion. For the last two years, through the AICV work that I've done with Cal State San Bernardino and the Inland Empire Journalism Fund, amongst others, I've watched the same pattern repeat itself. Intense curiosity, a few events and experiments, and then a long pause. The PS AI and Creativity Expo held last year on June 23rd was a good example. We filled the rooms. We had artists and technologists and educators and small business owners under one roof. And you could feel people realizing, oh, this isn't science fiction anymore. And then everyone went back to their day jobs and the systems kept changing, but without us. Meanwhile, the broader AI world isn't waiting. The compute powering AI has exploded. Frontier models are getting cheaper and more capable and cognitive tasks that used to be protected. Things like research, analysis, content creation, basic planning, they're now on the menu. Employers are testing AI for scheduling, pricing, forecasting, and. And customer service. The gap is opening not between people who love the technology and the people who don't, but between people who learn to use these tools and the people who pretend nothing is happening. The Coachella Valley sits right on that fault line. Our economy is rooted in hospitality, healthcare, logistics, education, and local services, and those sectors are not going to vanish. Instead, AI will quietly reorganize who has leverage inside them. In hospitals and clinics, AI is already being piloted to summarize records, flag risks, and support diagnostics. That could mean less time charting and more time with patients. Or it could mean tighter productivity expectations and more surveillance, depending on who designs the workflow. In hotels, resorts and venues, AI is creeping into guest messaging, dynamic pricing, and staffing models. Yeah, it won't replace the warmth of a front desk agent or a server, but it will influence how many of them get scheduled and determine what good performance looks like. Education that's another pressure point. In our work with CSUSB and local partners, we've seen faculty and students eager to engage with AI. But the institutional response is uneven. Some classrooms experiment with AI assisted research, lesson planning and language support. Others pretend AI doesn't exist, even as students quietly use it at home. That gap becomes a class divide whose kids graduate fluent in the tools that will shape white collar work, and whose kids learn to fear or ignore them? On the media side, the Inland Empire Journalism Fund has been trying to model what it looks like to cover AI responsibly and use it responsibly. That means using AI to assist with background research, transcription and idea generation while still putting human judgment, ethics and local sourcing at the center. It also means telling stories about AI's impact here, not just recycling national headlines. The frustrating part is how often those stories feel early for the read region. People across the board are nodding, agreeing that we should do something, but then defaulting back to business as usual. Going back to that event that I mentioned, the Palm Springs AI and Creativity Expo, it showed that the interest might be there. There were artists that explored AI assisted visuals, writers tested generative tools, and community members asked smart questions about bias, jobs and power. But an event is not a strategy without follow through, such as workshops, pilot programs, shared infrastructure, a bias for action. The expo just becomes a memory instead of a turning point. By the way, right here I was going to go ahead and list all the AI updates and releases and exponential capabilities from June 24 to February 2. But the list got so long I just felt as though that was me, just like, you know, kicking a kicking someone when they were down. Didn't need to do it, but you know what I'm saying, talking about, so what do we actually do? Well, if we want to stop being passive spectators and start owning a piece of the future, the rest of my newsletter goes into a practical playbook for the residents, employers and leaders of the Coachella Valley. It. That's my interstitial between the deep dive conversation. Again, I don't I do have written a wonderful playbook, again, opinionated playbook of what I think needs to happen and give some solutions. Not just complaining, but coming up with a bunch of solutions. And it's not a ploy for you to subscribe to my newsletter because at the end of the day, you subscribe, you subscribe, you don't. No worries. This I'm not I do not want to play the game that we've created with social media for the last 15 years. Treadmill not planning on getting on that anytime soon. But if you want to know the rest of the playbook or you have you want to read the newsletter, just subscribe to my newsletter at what is it? Sunshine fm.beehive.com Remember, Beehive is a fantastic newsletter platform and it's spelled B E E H I I V. Or you can just go to Sunshine fm. There's a button on there that says newsletter and you can go there and you can read all the various years long worth of thought pieces. And while this newsletter will not have been published yet, because I'm planning on publishing it later this week, it will be up there and you can always subscribe there if you wanted. Okay. And by the way, if you're a local media person or outlet and you want to feature some of the conversations and the pieces I bring up and want to go into a deeper dive about it, reach out to me. DM me. That's also on Sunshine fm. You can email me there. And those folks that know me in town, you've got my phone number. You can DM me anytime you want. Okay, so what else is happening? Okay, not this week, but next week. There's a wonderful creative community that's been slowly coming together over the last year in Palm Springs, and they're also been coming together around technology and the creative arts. They come from various mediums, they come from various sectors, but they're all creative folks. And the founders reached out to me a while ago, actually came from a workshop last year and and wanted to talk about how AI and the where AI might be taking creative work and where AI and creativity might learn to work together or how will it go into the future. And so we have an event next week. It's going to be about 20, 25 people have registered. I'm not doing the event coordination piece, so I'm not exactly sure. How many people have registered but that's supposed to be coming around the corner and if you're interested, if you're a creative and you're into AI and creativity, reach out. You have my you can get a hold of me on Sunshine FM and happy to share the organizers info and see if you can get in because I think it might be sold out. Actually I'm not sure but you can DM me and I can let you know from there. And then another interesting one is you just heard me talk about my kind of kind of like push for AI embrace and following through with a strategy, not just an event. The PS I co branded their follow up events called Future ps. They've only had two events so far, both at the Palm Springs no sorry Agua Caliente Cultural center. One in November and then one just last month in January. I heard they're having one in February and I thought they might have information already on their on the Palm Springs Chamber website, but I do not see it. So apologize for that. But I think it was. Did they say February? February 17th I want to say, but who knows. Reach out to Palm Springs Chamber, Nona Palm Springs Chamber. You can reach out to her and see when the next AI event is. Future PS in Palm Springs supposed to happen sometime in February. So there's that. AI in marketing and that we're putting together for September. But before that there's an AI in non profit world. I do not know the details. I do need to reach out to the folks that are putting together and get more information. As a matter of fact I'll make a note to myself right now. I need to see what those dates are so I can let you know about it. But also at the same time let me attend that and report to you fresh from having attended those two events, AI and non profits. If you have any AI events or even just events that could have some aspect of AI in which you know at the end of the day maybe it's too early for you, but for me it's like every single person piece of news, every article I read, every new business that opens up. As a strategist, I think in terms of I wonder how they're using AI in their in their business. I wonder how they're they could be even better if they use certain AI integrations and I'm very curious about that and I think part of our signals segments in these shows are going to surface a lot more local businesses and organizations to have that conversation either live on air or just opinions about it. And strategic advisement, even though I wasn't even asked. All right, so that's our episode for the day. That's our signal for the start of the week. Actually, the start of the month. It is a short month. So if you got budgets, you've only got 26 days to get them to meet them and get them beat if you can. It's been warm this weekend, which is a surprise. We're in the start of February, and it was pretty, pretty warm up on the trail, which I don't mind. It's better than having your wedding plans canceled over the weekend because of the rain like we had in December. But I love the heat. That's why I'm here in Palm Springs Coachella. And as you know, my goal for this year is to convince several of my friends from the Bay Area that when they become super wealthy, super rich, yes, they can go to Miami or to Austin or to Utah. But I want them to. I want them to consider Palm Springs Coachella. Why not? Because of the talent or the universities or the investor class. That's not here. Could be, but it's not. And there's no startup ecosystem, and that's what Sunshine FM is going to try and do. But, you know, I tell them, I tell them because then they can help Sunshine FM create that startup ecosystem that we want and more so. And when they say, what can you guarantee me? I say, the only thing Sunshine FM guarantees you is 350 days of sunshine and blue skies. Yes, indeed. All right, so here's a. Here's a cool little tune that we wrote for. We co wrote and co created for the Palm Springs Air Museum. And after that, I'm going to finish off with Rani and her checking in. Instrumental Fade out. This one's called Silver Wings and Satin Shoes. We see you again tomorrow. Talk soon.
